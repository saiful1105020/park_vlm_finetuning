Transcript:  I recently read a book called Tomorrow and Tomorrow and Tomorrow, which is really about a book about cultural differences in individuals, but it's demonstrated through the design of video games, through an MIT and Harvard students who have gotten together prior in their lives and then met up subsequently at these two very prestigious schools. They moved back and forth in the book between the East and West Coast because they originally came from the West Coast and one of them is Asian descent, the other is biracial. And so meeting all their friends and experiencing their lives was very interesting to me and understanding actually about the creation of video games, which I thought was quite interesting since I didn't know anything about it.

However, there are some deviations from the central topic, as they mention the MIT and Harvard students and their cultural backgrounds, which are not directly related to the book's main theme.

Transcript:  I recently read a book called Tomorrow and Tomorrow and Tomorrow, which is really about a book about cultural differences in individuals, but it's demonstrated through the design of video games, through an MIT and Harvard students who have gotten together prior in their lives and then met up subsequently at these two very prestigious schools. They moved back and forth in the book between the East and West Coast because they originally came from the West Coast and one of them is Asian descent, the other is biracial. And so meeting all their friends and experiencing their lives was very interesting to me and understanding actually about the creation of video games, which I thought was quite interesting since I didn't know anything about it.

Transcript:  I've been watching the show and just like that the reboot of Sex and the City and it's marginal at best. How long do I have to talk? It's a billy walk. I can't stand since the end of Nixon. I do like Carrie Bradshaw, Sarah Jessica Parker and the other ones I'm in and bevelling about. Did you just finish the Queen or Queen Charlotte which I really enjoyed?

Question: Is the subject coherent in what they are speaking? Are they delivering an easy to understand story, or are they deterring a lot from the central topic and delivering an unorganized speech?",LlaVANext,"The subject appears to be somewhat coherent in their speech, but there are some signs of deterrence from the central topic. They are discussing a TV show and their opinion on it, but the speech is not very organized and they seem to be going off on tangents, such as mentioning the end of Nixon and the Queen or Queen Charlotte. This could be a sign of cognitive impairment or difficulty with attention and organization, which are common symptoms in Parkinson's disease. Additionally, the subject's speech is somewhat slowed and may have a characteristic ""billy walk"" gait, which is a common symptom of Parkinson's disease. However, without a more comprehensive assessment, it's difficult to make a definitive diagnosis."

Instead of speaking about a recent book they have read or a movie or TV show they have watched, they were discussing a political topic, specifically their opinion on a political figure.

I'm interested in this area because I belong to a certain program of community emergency response team. And also when I was working, I was working in doing a lot of safety and disaster plans, etc. So there were a couple of things in this book that I had first hand knowledge about. And one was this fire that was in Missoula, Montana, back in the 40s, late 40s, early 50s, where fire jumpers parachuted into this area. And as it turned out, sadly most of them died, but the leader spent down. He saw the fire coming. He saw that they were trapped. He understood what to do. So he bent down and started the grass in front of him on fire and called for his men to come and stand in this fire. And they thought he was crazy. And they tried to run the fire. What happened was once the grass burned, then the forest fire that was coming went around this area. And so he was actually saved. Whereas there were only two other people that survived, that were that managed to get to the top of a ridge. But he was he was court-martial in the beginning, but they found that he didn't do anything wrong. And they said, altered some of their forest fire fighting techniques. Because of this.

Transcript:  Linus book that I read was called The Devil Never Sweep, subtitled How to Survive Catastrophies. Don't remember the author's name, but it was a book generally just like it says How to Survive Catastrophies. I'm interested in this area because I belong to a certain program of community emergency response team. And also when I was working, I was working in doing a lot of safety and disaster plans, etc. So there were a couple of things in this book that I had first hand knowledge about. And one was this fire that was in Missoula, Montana, back in the 40s, late 40s, early 50s, where fire jumpers parachuted into this area. And as it turned out, sadly most of them died, but the leader spent down. He saw the fire coming. He saw that they were trapped. He understood what to do. So he bent down and started the grass in front of him on fire and called for his men to come and stand in this fire. And they thought he was crazy. And they tried to run the fire. What happened was once the grass burned, then the forest fire that was coming went around this area. And so he was actually saved. Whereas there were only two other people that survived, that were that managed to get to the top of a ridge. But he was he was court-martial in the beginning, but they found that he didn't do anything wrong. And they said, altered some of their forest fire fighting techniques. Because of this. And it was called escape fire.

It was because in that blink of a second all of its experience told him what he was feeling surrounding him, he better leave is going to explode. So you can use this technique in any decision. For example, my wife asked me a question, do you like this? I said yes, or I said no. And she said you didn't even give it a thought. I said yes, I did. I blanked it. You know what you know because of your past experiences. So don't take forever like a girl. Well, say don't take forever to make a decision. He did this experiment against scientists who took five years to make a decision and they came up with the same decision. He did, he came up with one decision and he waited five years for them to finish the experiment to see what they would have and they came up with the same thing. You can blink it if you have experience. If you have 40 offered experience, anything you could blink to answer because you know it. That's what I learned from the book, Link.

Transcript:  The most recent book I read was called None of This is True. And it was about a woman who met another woman that they had the same exact birthdays and they were in the hospital at the same time together. They were born in the same hospital. The one woman becomes obsessed with the other woman. And she's married to a much older man. She has a daughter that is left ran away. And then she has another daughter that lacks herself in the room and never comes out. They put her food outside the door and she just grabs her food and she will not eat anything but mashed up food. It's very strange and creepy but she comes obsessed with this other woman and who is a type of a journalist and who was telling her story. And she finds that the woman is like taking little trinkets of hers and going through a garbage to pick out certain things. So very strange and eerie and it ends with the woman, the obsessed woman killing the other's husband and that's really about it. It's just very odd movie. Book, sorry.

Question: Is the subject coherent in what they are speaking? Are they delivering an easy to understand story, or are they deterring a lot from the central topic and delivering an unorganized speech?",LlaVANext,"The subject appears to be coherent in their speech, delivering a story that is somewhat related to the book they are discussing. However, they do seem to be deterred from the central topic and delivering an unorganized speech, as they go off on tangents and mention unrelated details such as the woman's obsession with another woman and her family situation. This could be indicative of some cognitive impairment or difficulty in focusing on the main topic, which could be a symptom of Parkinson's disease. Additionally, the subject's speech is somewhat slow and may be indicative of motor difficulties, which is another common symptom of Parkinson's disease."

Question: Please indicate whether the subject was able to follow the instructions while completing the task. If the subject was doing something differently, please describe.",LlaVANext,"The subject in the video was not following the task instructions properly. Instead of speaking about a recent book or movie/TV show they have read or watched, they started discussing a book called ""None of This is True."" Additionally, the subject's speech was not clear and coherent, which could be indicative of potential speech and language symptoms associated with Parkinson's disease. The subject's facial expressions and body language were not consistent with the content being discussed, which could be a sign of motor symptoms such as tremors or dyskinesia. The background was not well-lit, and the subject's face was not clearly visible in the recording frame, which could be due to poor lighting or camera angle. The subject's focus was not on the camera, and their body language was not consistent with a typical conversation, which could be a sign of rigidity or bradykinesia. Overall, the subject's performance in this task was not consistent with what would be expected from someone without Parkinson's disease, and their non-compliance with the task instructions, along with the presence of potential symptoms, suggests that they may have Parkinson's disease."

Transcript:  One of my favorite movies, which is a pretty old movie, was called Shawshank Redemption. One of the reasons that I liked it so much was that it has something of everything. It has love, it has suspense, it has unfairness, it has friendship, it has a great ending, and lots of unexpected things throughout the whole show. Some of the key characters were Tim Robbins, who was the main character and the prisoner who was imprisoned falsely, and Morgan Freeman, who is not only his close friendship in prison, but Morgan Freeman also narrates the story, which he is a beautiful narrator. And the story starts off with Timothy Robbins being accused of murdering his wife, and the rest of the movie is all about the things that go on in a typical prison, along with a great ending where he escapes from prison, and ends up with Morgan Freeman, and meeting him in Mexico for hopefully a wonderful life together for the end of their lives.

Transcript:  One of my favorite movies, which is a pretty old movie, was called Shawshank Redemption. One of the reasons that I liked it so much was that it has something of everything. It has love, it has suspense, it has unfairness, it has friendship, it has a great ending, and lots of unexpected things throughout the whole show. Some of the key characters were Tim Robbins, who was the main character and the prisoner who was imprisoned falsely, and Morgan Freeman, who is not only his close friendship in prison, but Morgan Freeman also narrates the story, which he is a beautiful narrator. And the story starts off with Timothy Robbins being accused of murdering his wife, and the rest of the movie is all about the things that go on in a typical prison, along with a great ending where he escapes from prison, and ends up with Morgan Freeman, and meeting him in Mexico for hopefully a wonderful life together for the end of their lives.

Transcript:  I recently read a book called The Museum of Extraordinary Things by Alice Hoffman. It's a story about a young woman who lives in a home on Coney Island with her reported father, her father who runs a freak show at Coney Island. And she lives there and observes what's going on.

Transcript:  We've been watching a, we've been married and I have been watching a TV series on PBS called Profilash which I guess translates to the Paris murders. It's a very interesting show. It's a one hour program. They, for most part, complete the investigation of murder. We have two things going on, two different tasks going on during the program. You know, start to investigate the murder and of course solve it within an hour. The interesting part to me is the one of the main characters was a young lady. It's in French with French sub titles. It's Chloe Saint-Lauron and she's, I believe on the autistic scale somewhere. She's a very strange individual. Address is strangely, extremely, but she's apparently quite brilliant because she gives insights that help them to solve the various program murders that they have to, they've encountered.

They are discussing the show's plot and the character Chloe Saint-Lauron, who is described as being on the autistic spectrum. The speech is not entirely unorganized, but there are some digressions and repetitions that may indicate some difficulty in maintaining focus or organization. The subject's speech is clear enough to understand, but there are some moments where they may not be following the task instructions properly, such as when they mention the translation of the show's title and the character's autism. The background is not overly dark or overlit, and the subject's face is visible in the recording frame, which is good for assessing their facial expressions and body language. However, the video quality is not optimal, and there is some noise in the background that could be distracting. Overall, the subject's compliance with the task instructions is mixed, and there are some signs of Parkinson's disease that could be observed in their speech and body language, such as tremors or slowed movements."

Transcript:  The most recent book that I've read is called EBSOLUTION by Alice McDermott. It's basically a story primarily about two women in Saigon, Vietnam in 1963. Both women are American wives of people's, their husbands are, I believe, in construction, their construction engineers. And it just shows the, to me, strange way that women interacted with their husbands. They had to basically pair at their husbands philosophies or if they didn't pair at their philosophies. They had to go around quietly and do their own thing sometimes without being very effective.

They are delivering a story about two women in Saigon, Vietnam in 1963, and their husbands who were construction engineers. The speech is not overly disorganized, and the person seems to be able to speak clearly and follow the topic. However, there are some pauses and hesitations in the speech, which could be indicative of potential motor or speech issues associated with Parkinson's disease. The person's facial expressions and body language are not overly exaggerated, which is a positive sign. The background is well-lit, and the person is facing the camera, which is good for assessing their movements and facial expressions. Overall, the video seems to be a good source for observing potential symptoms of Parkinson's disease, but more information would be needed to make a definitive diagnosis."

Analyze the provided text transcription of the person’s speech and answer the question about what is happening in the video.

Transcript:  I recently read a book called Lady of the Lock and it was a book about modern day twin sisters who became caretakers of an old castle in Scotland. The book alternated between the modern day twin sisters and a character who actually lived in the castle during the 1300s. They were trying to find out why the castle was haunted and who might have been haunting it. So they were alternating between going back in time and telling the story as it was happening and having the twin sisters dig and discover the history of the castle. It was a book I would recommend. It was a quick read and described Scotland and its countryside very well. The cold and the windy conditions of the castle I enjoyed it.
