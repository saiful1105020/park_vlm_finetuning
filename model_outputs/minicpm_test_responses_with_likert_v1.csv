Transcript:  I recently read a book called Tomorrow and Tomorrow and Tomorrow, which is really about a book about cultural differences in individuals, but it's demonstrated through the design of video games, through an MIT and Harvard students who have gotten together prior in their lives and then met up subsequently at these two very prestigious schools. They moved back and forth in the book between the East and West Coast because they originally came from the West Coast and one of them is Asian descent, the other is biracial. And so meeting all their friends and experiencing their lives was very interesting to me and understanding actually about the creation of video games, which I thought was quite interesting since I didn't know anything about it.

Transcript:  I recently read a book called Tomorrow and Tomorrow and Tomorrow, which is really about a book about cultural differences in individuals, but it's demonstrated through the design of video games, through an MIT and Harvard students who have gotten together prior in their lives and then met up subsequently at these two very prestigious schools. They moved back and forth in the book between the East and West Coast because they originally came from the West Coast and one of them is Asian descent, the other is biracial. And so meeting all their friends and experiencing their lives was very interesting to me and understanding actually about the creation of video games, which I thought was quite interesting since I didn't know anything about it.

And as it turned out, sadly most of them died, but the leader bent down. He saw the fire coming. He saw that they were trapped. He understood what to do. So he bent down and started the grass in front of him on fire and called for his men to come and stand in this fire. And they thought he was crazy. And they tried to run the fire. What happened was once the grass burned, then the forest fire that was coming went around this area. And so he was actually saved. Whereas there were only two other people that survived, that were that managed to get to the top of a ridge. But he was he was court-martial in the beginning, but they found that he didn't do anything wrong. And they since altered some of their forest fire fighting techniques. Because of this.

Transcript:  Linus book that I read was called The Devil Never Sweep, subtitled How to Survive Catastrophies. Don't remember the author's name, but it was a book generally just like it says How to Survive Catastrophies. I'm interested in this area because I belong to a certain program of community emergency response team. And also when I was working, I was working in doing a lot of safety and disaster plans, etc. So there were a couple of things in this book that I had first hand knowledge about. And one was this fire that was in Missoula, Montana back in the 40s, late 40s, early 50s, where fire jumpers parachuted into this area. And as it turned out, sadly most of them died, but the leader bent down. He saw the fire coming. He saw that they were trapped. He understood what to do. So he bent down and started the grass in front of him on fire and called for his men to come and stand in this fire. And they thought he was crazy. And they tried to run the fire. What happened was once the grass burned, then the forest fire that was coming went around this area. And so he was actually saved. Whereas there were only two other people that survived, that were that managed to get to the top of a ridge. But he was he was court-martial in the beginning, but they found that he didn't do anything wrong. And they since altered some of their forest fire fighting techniques. Because of this. And it was called escape fire.

It was because in that blink of a second all of its experience told him what he was feeling surrounding him, he better leave is going to explode. So you can use this technique in any decision. For example, my wife asked me a question, do you like this? I said yes, or I said no. And she said you didn't even give it a thought. I said yes, I did. I blanked it. You know what you know because of your past experiences. So don't take forever like a girl. Well, say don't take forever to make a decision. He did this experiment against scientists who took five years to make a decision and they came up with the same decision. He did, he came up with one decision and he waited five years for them to finish the experiment to see what they would have and they came up with the same thing. You can blink it if you have experience. If you have 40 offered experience, anything you could blink to answer because you know it. That's what I learned from the book, Link.

The one woman becomes obsessed with the other woman. And she's married to a much older man. She has a daughter that is left ran away. And then she has another daughter that lacks herself in the room and never comes out. They put her food outside the door and she just grabs her food and she will not eat anything but mashed up food. It's very strange and creepy but she comes obsessed with this other woman and who is a type of a journalist and who was telling her story. And she finds that the woman is like taking little trinkets of hers and going through a garbage to pick out certain things. So very strange and eerie and it ends with the woman, the obsessed woman killing the other's husband and that's really about it. It's just very odd movie. Book, sorry.

Transcript:  One of my favorite movies, which is a pretty old movie, was called Shawshank Redemption. One of the reasons that I liked it so much was that it has something of everything. It has love, it has suspense, it has unfairness, it has friendship, it has a great ending, and lots of unexpected things throughout the whole show. Some of the key characters were Tim Robbins, who was the main character and the prisoner who was imprisoned falsely, and Morgan Freeman, who is not only his close friendship in prison, but Morgan Freeman also narrates the story, which he is a beautiful narrator. And the story starts off with Timothy Robbins being accused of murdering his wife, and the rest of the movie is all about the things that go on in a typical prison, along with a great ending where he escapes from prison, and ends up with Morgan Freeman, and meeting him in Mexico for hopefully a wonderful life together for the end of their lives.

It's a story about a young woman who lives in a home on Coney Island with her reported father, her father who runs a freak show at Coney Island. And she lives there and observes what's going on. This is around 1911. At the same time, there's a young man who's an immigrant from Eastern Europe who lives in Manhattan. And he separates from his father and they eventually find each other. And there's some things that happen in the connection of 1911 such as a triangle shirt waist fire that he observes as a photographer. And she observes the fire that burns down Coney Island and they get together and become lovers after a period of time when they are seeking each other.

Transcript:  My wife told me about American pickers. I have been watching this for a number of years and they pick up different items that are interesting and they chain items that they highlight. It's about common things that you and I may want to buy for our house. So, it's interesting. It's whatever you might want to think about. Today they had a 1923 Buick. I'm trying to think of what it is. It was a cap for the radiator cap. It's interesting. How I'm losing track of things like this. You would think that I wouldn't have a problem with remembering something like that, but I do.

It's a one hour program. They, for most part, complete the investigation of murder. There we have two things going on, two different tasks going on during the program. You know, start to investigate the murder and of course solve it within an hour. The interesting part to me is the one of the main characters was a young lady. It's in French with French sub subtiles. It's Chloe Saint-Lauron and she's, I believe on the autistic scale somewhere. She's a very strange individual. Address is strangely, extremely, but she's apparently quite brilliant because she gives insights that help them to solve the various program murders that they have to, they've encountered.

Transcript:  I recently read a book called Lady of the Lock and it was a book about modern day twin sisters who became caretakers of an old castle in Scotland. The book alternated between the modern day twin sisters and a character who actually lived in the castle during the 1300s. They were trying to find out why the castle was haunted and who might have been haunting it. So they were alternating between going back in time and telling the story as it was happening and having the twin sisters dig and discover the history of the castle. It was a book I would recommend. It was a quick read and described Scotland and its countryside very well. The cold and the windy conditions of the castle I enjoyed it.

Transcript:  I am currently reading a book called The Detective Inventory Art. It's really an interesting book. It's about the reflections of a main police officer. This man came up from some places in New York, New Jersey area, and he retired in Maine as a policeman. He describes the things that are different about the environment, in Maine, where it's a big city of urban sprawl, if you will. It is in these coasts. It's really kind of neat. It comes about a lot of things that people don't realize the police officers have to get you to have to deal with every day. And a lot of them are funny and so on and so on. It's not so funny. It's an interesting book and I think that he has to read it. It is the author and it is needed. Take care.
