Transcript:  I recently read a book called Tomorrow and Tomorrow and Tomorrow, which is really about a book about cultural differences in individuals, but it's demonstrated through the design of video games, through an MIT and Harvard students who have gotten together prior in their lives and then met up subsequently at these two very prestigious schools. They moved back and forth in the book between the East and West Coast because they originally came from the West Coast and one of them is Asian descent, the other is biracial. And so meeting all their friends and experiencing their lives was very interesting to me and understanding actually about the creation of video games, which I thought was quite interesting since I didn't know anything about it.

Question: Is the subject coherent in what they are speaking? Are they delivering an easy to understand story, or are they deterring a lot from the central topic and delivering an unorganized speech?",LlaVANext,"The subject appears to be coherent in their speech, and they are delivering a story that is somewhat related to the topic of the book they are discussing. However, there are some deviations from the central topic, as they mention the MIT and Harvard students and their cultural backgrounds, which are not directly related to the book's main theme. The speech is not entirely unorganized, but there are some meandering elements that may suggest a lack of focus or difficulty in staying on the main topic. The person's speech is clear and understandable, but there are some signs of potential cognitive impairment or difficulty in organizing thoughts that could be associated with Parkinson's disease.",3,"The response notes that the subject is coherent and clear, but also explicitly mentions “some deviations from the central topic,” “meandering elements,” and “a lack of focus or difficulty in staying on the main topic.” This conflicts with the NEW_QUESTION’s requirement that the speech “stays focused on the central topic (no unorganized detours).” Overall, the description suggests partially coherent and understandable speech but with noticeable off-topic and organizational issues.

The person can also show symptoms that may be associated with having Parkinson's disease. Focus on the noises, task instructions, user compliance, and possible symptoms of Parkinson's disease while answering the question.

Task instructions: The person will talk about a recent book they have read or a movie or TV show they have watched. The person will speak for approximately one minute. They should be front-facing the camera, and their face must be visible in the recording frame. There should not be any other person visible in the recording frame. The background should not be dark or overlit and should have good contrast against the person's face. For this task, the face is the most crucial body part you should focus on. However, you should also observe other body parts for relevant symptoms or signs of Parkinson's disease.

Analyze the provided text transcription of the person’s speech and answer the question about what is happening in the video.

Transcript:  Now you can talk. Ending Parkinson's by Dr. Dorsey. You want to talk a little bit about what was in the book? It touched mainly about the use of pesticides and how the use of pesticides in the United States is causing a Parkinson's pandemic. You can go ahead and press if finished.

Question: Is the subject coherent in what they are speaking? Are they delivering an easy to understand story, or are they deterring a lot from the central topic and delivering an unorganized speech?",LlaVANext,"Based on the provided transcription, the person appears to be somewhat coherent in their speech, as they are discussing a topic related to Parkinson's disease and a book they have read. However, they may be deterred from the central topic of the book and may not be delivering an entirely organized speech. The person's speech may be somewhat disorganized, as they are discussing a topic that is not directly related to the book they were asked to talk about. This could be a sign of cognitive impairment or difficulty in focusing on the task at hand. It is important to note that the presence of such symptoms alone is not diagnostic of Parkinson's disease, but it could be a sign of other neurological conditions or cognitive impairment.",3,"The response says the person is “somewhat coherent” but also “may not be delivering an entirely organized speech,” is “somewhat disorganized,” and is talking about something “not directly related to the book they were asked to talk about.” This indicates partial coherence but clear problems with focus and organization, which conflicts with the fully positive statement in the NEW_QUESTION.

A moderate but not strong alignment is implied.

**Likert Score: 3**","The subject’s speech is coherent, easy to understand, and stays focused on the central topic(no unorganized detours)."

Task instructions: The person will talk about a recent book they have read or a movie or TV show they have watched. The person will speak for approximately one minute. They should be front-facing the camera, and their face must be visible in the recording frame. There should not be any other person visible in the recording frame. The background should not be dark or overlit and should have good contrast against the person's face. For this task, the face is the most crucial body part you should focus on. However, you should also observe other body parts for relevant symptoms or signs of Parkinson's disease.

Analyze the provided text transcription of the person’s speech and answer the question about what is happening in the video.

Transcript:  I've been watching the show and just like that the reboot of Sex and the City and it's marginal at best. How long do I have to talk? It's a billy walk. I can't stand since the end of Nixon. I do like Carrie Bradshaw, Sarah Jessica Parker and the other ones I'm in and bevelling about. Did you just finish the Queen or Queen Charlotte which I really enjoyed?

Question: Please indicate whether the subject was able to follow the instructions while completing the task. If the subject was doing something differently, please describe.",LlaVANext,"The subject in the video was not following the task instructions properly. Instead of speaking about a recent book they have read or a movie or TV show they have watched, they were discussing a political topic, specifically their opinion on a political figure. Additionally, the subject's speech was not clear and coherent, with pauses and hesitations, which could be indicative of motor symptoms commonly associated with Parkinson's disease. The subject's facial expressions were not consistent, and their body language was not focused on the camera, which is not typical for a task that requires attention to the camera. The background was not well-lit, and the contrast between the subject's face and the background was not optimal, making it difficult to assess the facial features clearly. The subject's overall demeanor and body language did not convey confidence or focus, which is not typical for someone who is supposed to be speaking about a recent book or show.",1,"The response explicitly states that the subject ""was not following the task instructions properly"" and describes multiple deviations (talking about politics instead of the requested topic, unclear speech, lack of focus on the camera). This directly contradicts the statement that the subject followed all instructions accurately with no deviations.

Therefore, alignment with the new question is very low.

The person can also show symptoms that may be associated with having Parkinson's disease. Focus on the noises, task instructions, user compliance, and possible symptoms of Parkinson's disease while answering the question.

Task instructions: The person will talk about a recent book they have read or a movie or TV show they have watched. The person will speak for approximately one minute. They should be front-facing the camera, and their face must be visible in the recording frame. There should not be any other person visible in the recording frame. The background should not be dark or overlit and should have good contrast against the person's face. For this task, the face is the most crucial body part you should focus on. However, you should also observe other body parts for relevant symptoms or signs of Parkinson's disease.

Answer the question about what is happening in the video. Keep your response short and precise.

So he bent down and started the grass in front of him on fire and called for his men to come and stand in this fire. And they thought he was crazy. And they tried to run the fire.

Transcript:  Linus book that I read was called The Devil Never Sweep, subtitled How to Survive Catastrophies. Don't remember the author's name, but it was a book generally just like it says How to Survive Catastrophies. I'm interested in this area because I belong to a certain program of community emergency response team. And also when I was working, I was working in doing a lot of safety and disaster plans, etc. So there were a couple of things in this book that I had first hand knowledge about. And one was this fire that was in Missoula, Montana, back in the 40s, late 40s, early 50s, where fire jumpers parachuted into this area. And as it turned out, sadly most of them died, but the leader spent down. He saw the fire coming. He saw that they were trapped. He understood what to do. So he bent down and started the grass in front of him on fire and called for his men to come and stand in this fire. And they thought he was crazy. And they tried to run the fire. What happened was once the grass burned, then the forest fire that was coming went around this area. And so he was actually saved. Whereas there were only two other people that survived, that were that managed to get to the top of a ridge. But he was he was court-martial in the beginning, but they found that he didn't do anything wrong. And they said, altered some of their forest fire fighting techniques. Because of this. And it was called escape fire.

The person can also show symptoms that may be associated with having Parkinson's disease. Focus on the noises, task instructions, user compliance, and possible symptoms of Parkinson's disease while answering the question.

Task instructions: The person will talk about a recent book they have read or a movie or TV show they have watched. The person will speak for approximately one minute. They should be front-facing the camera, and their face must be visible in the recording frame. There should not be any other person visible in the recording frame. The background should not be dark or overlit and should have good contrast against the person's face. For this task, the face is the most crucial body part you should focus on. However, you should also observe other body parts for relevant symptoms or signs of Parkinson's disease.

Question: Indicate which of the following are true for the subject: (i) The individual's face appears blank and emotionless, even when they are trying to express an emotion. (ii) The expression is weak or asymmetrical, and the individual has difficulty holding an expression (e.g., smile) for an extended period. Also mention if you observe other facial expression abnormalities. If there is nothing abnormal, output ""nothing abnormal"".",LlaVANext,"(i) The individual's face appears blank and emotionless, even when they are trying to express an emotion. (ii) The expression is weak or asymmetrical, and the individual has difficulty holding an expression (e.g., smile) for an extended period. Other facial expression abnormalities observed include a slight asymmetry in the eyebrows and a slight asymmetry in the mouth area.",1,"The response explicitly endorses both abnormalities listed in the OLD_QUESTION: a blank, emotionless face even when trying to express emotion, weak/asymmetrical expression, and difficulty holding a smile. It also notes additional asymmetry in eyebrows and mouth. This directly contradicts the NEW_QUESTION’s statement that expressions are natural, emotionally appropriate, and symmetrical without weakness or difficulty.

Therefore, alignment with the NEW_QUESTION is very low.

Transcript:  Last night I watched John Oliver, what is it called last week tonight. I believe his name is Joe, I missed John Oliver while he was a writer's strike. For the past five months and I'll talk shows have been off and I certainly felt an affinity for them being a member of the writer's field myself. So it was nice to see something back on in the reminder of the success of the strike. And John Oliver paid homage to the writers several times and then went through what we've missed in the last five months, which was quite a bit. But he of course picked out things that were very quirky and unique and very funny and then went on to his usual horrific subject. A horrific subject that society have, society's ills that we need to correct so but it was a very good show.

Transcript:  I would like to talk about the book Blake. I'm not going to get anywhere. One of my favorite authors, he talks about your mind and your experiences accumulate. So you can make decisions in the matter of a blank. Like for example, they talked about he gave an example of a fireman who ran into a building and his instinctive men's thoughts say run out now and he ran out the building and the building exploded. It was because in that blink of a second all of its experience told him what he was feeling surrounding him, he better leave is going to explode. So you can use this technique in any decision. For example, my wife asked me a question, do you like this? I said yes, or I said no. And she said you didn't even give it a thought. I said yes, I did. I blanked it. You know what you know because of your past experiences. So don't take forever like a girl. Well, say don't take forever to make a decision. He did this experiment against scientists who took five years to make a decision and they came up with the same decision. He did, he came up with one decision and he waited five years for them to finish the experiment to see what they would have and they came up with the same thing. You can blink it if you have experience. If you have 40 offered experience, anything you could blink to answer because you know it. That's what I learned from the book, Link.

The one woman becomes obsessed with the other woman. And she's married to a much older man. She has a daughter that is left ran away. And then she has another daughter that lacks herself in the room and never comes out. They put her food outside the door and she just grabs her food and she will not eat anything but mashed up food. It's very strange and creepy but she comes obsessed with this other woman and who is a type of a journalist and who was telling her story. And she finds that the woman is like taking little trinkets of hers and going through a garbage to pick out certain things. So very strange and eerie and it ends with the woman, the obsessed woman killing the other's husband and that's really about it. It's just very odd movie. Book, sorry.

Some of the key characters were Tim Robbins, who was the main character and the prisoner who was imprisoned falsely, and Morgan Freeman, who is not only his close friendship in prison, but Morgan Freeman also narrates the story, which he is a beautiful narrator. And the story starts off with Timothy Robbins being accused of murdering his wife, and the rest of the movie is all about the things that go on in a typical prison, along with a great ending where he escapes from prison, and ends up with Morgan Freeman, and meeting him in Mexico for hopefully a wonderful life together for the end of their lives.

Transcript:  One of my favorite movies, which is a pretty old movie, was called Shawshank Redemption. One of the reasons that I liked it so much was that it has something of everything. It has love, it has suspense, it has unfairness, it has friendship, it has a great ending, and lots of unexpected things throughout the whole show. Some of the key characters were Tim Robbins, who was the main character and the prisoner who was imprisoned falsely, and Morgan Freeman, who is not only his close friendship in prison, but Morgan Freeman also narrates the story, which he is a beautiful narrator. And the story starts off with Timothy Robbins being accused of murdering his wife, and the rest of the movie is all about the things that go on in a typical prison, along with a great ending where he escapes from prison, and ends up with Morgan Freeman, and meeting him in Mexico for hopefully a wonderful life together for the end of their lives.

Transcript:  I recently read a book called The Museum of Extraordinary Things by Alice Hoffman. It's a story about a young woman who lives in a home on Coney Island with her reported father, her father who runs a freak show at Coney Island. And she lives there and observes what's going on. This is around 1911. At the same time, there's a young man who's an immigrant from Eastern Europe who lives in Manhattan. And he separates from his father and they eventually find each other. And there's some things that happen in the connection of 1911 such as a triangle shirt waist fire that he observes as a photographer. And she observes the fire that burns down Coney Island and they get together and become lovers after a period of time when they are seeking each other.

It's about common things that you and I may want to buy for our house. So, it's interesting. It's whatever you might want to think about. Today they had a 1923 Buick. I'm trying to think of what it is. It was a cap for the radiator cap. It's interesting how I'm losing track of things like this.

They mention a 1923 Buick radiator cap and their difficulty in remembering certain details, which could be a symptom of Parkinson's disease. The person's speech is relatively easy to understand, and they are not deterred from the central topic. However, their delivery may be somewhat unorganized, as they seem to be losing track of certain details, which could be indicative of cognitive impairment or a symptom of Parkinson's disease.",4,"The response says the subject is “coherent,” “relatively easy to understand,” and “not deterred from the central topic,” which supports agreement with the new statement. However, it also notes that the delivery is “somewhat unorganized” and that the subject seems to lose track of certain details, indicating partial rather than full alignment with “no unorganized detours.”

It's Chloe Saint-Lauron and she's, I believe on the autistic scale somewhere. She's a very strange individual. Address is strangely, extremely, but she's apparently quite brilliant because she gives insights that help them to solve the various program murders that they have to, they've encountered.

They are discussing the show's plot and the character Chloe Saint-Lauron, who is described as being on the autistic spectrum. The speech is not entirely unorganized, but there are some digressions and repetitions that may indicate some difficulty in maintaining focus or organization. The subject's speech is clear enough to understand, but there are some moments where they may not be following the task instructions properly, such as when they mention the translation of the show's title and the character's autism. The background is not overly dark or overlit, and the subject's face is visible in the recording frame, which is good for assessing their facial expressions and body language. However, the video quality is not optimal, and there is some noise in the background that could be distracting. Overall, the subject's compliance with the task instructions is mixed, and there are some signs of Parkinson's disease that could be observed in their speech and body language, such as tremors or slowed movements.",3,"The response notes that the subject is ""coherent"" and ""clear enough to understand,"" and that their story is ""somewhat related to the topic."" However, it also highlights ""some digressions and repetitions,"" ""difficulty in maintaining focus or organization,"" and not always following task instructions.

Transcript:  The most recent book that I've read is called EBSOLUTION by Alice McDermott. It's basically a story primarily about two women in Saigon, Vietnam in 1963. Both women are American wives of people's, their husbands are, I believe, in construction, their construction engineers. And it just shows the, to me, strange way that women interacted with their husbands. They had to basically pair at their husbands philosophies or if they didn't pair at their philosophies. They had to go around quietly and do their own thing sometimes without being very effective.

Question: Is the subject coherent in what they are speaking?

They are delivering a story about two women in Saigon, Vietnam in 1963, and their husbands who were construction engineers. The speech is not overly disorganized, and the person seems to be able to speak clearly and follow the topic. However, there are some pauses and hesitations in the speech, which could be indicative of potential motor or speech issues associated with Parkinson's disease. The person's facial expressions and body language are not overly exaggerated, which is a positive sign. The background is well-lit, and the person is facing the camera, which is good for assessing their movements and facial expressions. Overall, the video seems to be a good source for observing potential symptoms of Parkinson's disease, but more information would be needed to make a definitive diagnosis.",4,"The response explicitly states that the subject “appears to be coherent,” is “delivering a story” that is “not overly disorganized,” and “seems to be able to speak clearly and follow the topic.” These points strongly support the idea that the speech is coherent, understandable, and focused. The mention of “some pauses and hesitations” suggests minor issues but not major detours or disorganization. Overall, the description aligns well with the positive statement, with only slight reservations.

The book alternated between the modern day twin sisters and a character who actually lived in the castle during the 1300s. They were trying to find out why the castle was haunted and who might have been haunting it. So they were alternating between going back in time and telling the story as it was happening and having the twin sisters dig and discover the history of the castle. It was a book I would recommend. It was a quick read and described Scotland and its countryside very well. The cold and the windy conditions of the castle I enjoyed it.

Transcript:  I am currently reading a book called The Detective Inventory Art. It's really an interesting book. It's about the reflections of a main police officer. This man came up from some places in New York, New Jersey area, and he retired in Maine as a policeman. He describes the things that are different about the environment, in Maine, where it's a big city of urban, it's probably, if you will, it isn't in these coasts. It's really kind of neat. It comes about a lot of things that people don't realize the police officers have to get you to have to deal with every day. And a lot of them are funny and so-so and so on. They're not so funny. It's an interesting book and I think that if you can see it's a reading, it's a reading. It's actually kind of the author and it's just neat. Yeah, he's taking care of it.

They are front-facing the camera and their face is visible in the recording frame, which is good for assessing their facial expressions and any potential symptoms of Parkinson's disease. The background is not too dark or overlit, and there is good contrast against the person's face, which is important for observing any signs of the condition. The subject's speech is clear and understandable, and they seem to be engaged in the task.",5,"The response explicitly states that “the subject in the video appears to be following the task instructions” and then lists several behaviors (talking about the book, facing the camera, visible face, appropriate lighting, clear speech, engagement) that are all consistent with the instructions. No deviations or problems are mentioned anywhere in the description. This strongly supports the statement that the subject followed all instructions accurately.

**Likert Score: 5**",The subject followed all instructions accurately while completing the task (no deviationsobserved).

It is observed in the video that the person's lips are parting very few times during the task.,2,"The response states that “the person's lips are parting very few times during the task.” This means the lips do part occasionally, so it contradicts the statement that the lips are “never parted when not speaking.” However, since parting occurs only very few times, the behavior is still somewhat close to “never,” just not fully consistent with it.

**Likert Score: 4**","The subject’s lips are never parted when not speaking (e.g., closed or slightly parted most ofthe time)."

Now, you are watching a home-recorded video of a person performing some tasks used to assess Parkinson's disease. No experts supervise the person, so there can be different types of noise, or the person may not follow the task instructions properly. The person can also show symptoms that may be associated with having Parkinson's disease. Focus on the noises, task instructions, user compliance, and possible symptoms of Parkinson's disease while answering the question.

Task instructions: The person will talk about a recent book they have read or a movie or TV show they have watched. The person will speak for approximately one minute. They should be front-facing the camera, and their face must be visible in the recording frame. There should not be any other person visible in the recording frame. The background should not be dark or overlit and should have good contrast against the person's face. For this task, the face is the most crucial body part you should focus on. However, you should also observe other body parts for relevant symptoms or signs of Parkinson's disease.

Question: Indicate which of the following are true for the subject: (i) The individual's face appears blank and emotionless, even when they are trying to express an emotion. (ii) The expression is weak or asymmetrical, and the individual has difficulty holding an expression (e.g., smile) for an extended period. Also mention if you observe other facial expression abnormalities.

(ii) The expression is weak or asymmetrical, and the individual has difficulty holding an expression (e.g., smile) for an extended period. Other facial expression abnormalities include a possible asymmetrical mouth opening and a lack of blinking.",1,"The response explicitly endorses both abnormalities listed in the OLD_QUESTION: a blank/emotionless face and weak/asymmetrical expressions with difficulty holding them. It also adds further abnormalities (asymmetrical mouth opening, lack of blinking). This directly contradicts the NEW_QUESTION, which describes natural, emotionally appropriate, and symmetrical expressions without such issues.

Therefore, alignment with the NEW_QUESTION is very low.

**Likert Score: 1**","The subject’s facial expressions are natural, emotionally appropriate, and symmetrical (noblank/emotionless face, weakness, asymmetry, or difficulty holding expressions)."

Question: Document any abnormal signs observed in body parts other than the face. This includes, but is not limited to, tremors in the hands, involuntary shaking or rhythmic movements of the upper or lower extremities, stiffness or rigidity in the limbs, reduced arm swing while speaking, or any signs of bradykinesia (slowness of movement).

There are also some involuntary shaking or rhythmic movements in the hands, which could be indicative of Parkinsonian tremor. The person's posture is somewhat stooped, and they have difficulty in maintaining balance while speaking. These observations suggest that the individual may have Parkinson's disease.",1,"The response clearly describes multiple abnormal signs: mild to moderate bradykinesia, rigidity in the limbs, involuntary shaking/rhythmic movements in the hands, stooped posture, and difficulty maintaining balance.

Transcript:  I watched a movie the other day. I don't think it was very good. I'm not sure that I really remember it. I don't watch many movies, so I don't know that I can give an opinion of it. Let me see if I can remember any of the movie. Wow, it really is difficult to remember. I don't know. I'm struggling greatly remembering something to say here. I don't know. I guess I'm just rambling on for the minute. I hope this doesn't hurt this. Thank you.
