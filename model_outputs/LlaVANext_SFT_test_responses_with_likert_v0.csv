However, they may be deterred from the central topic of the book and may not be delivering an entirely organized speech. The person's speech may be somewhat disorganized, as they are discussing a topic that is not directly related to the book they were asked to talk about. This could be a sign of cognitive impairment or difficulty in focusing on the task at hand. It is important to note that the presence of such symptoms alone does not necessarily indicate Parkinson's disease, as other neurological conditions or cognitive impairments can also cause similar symptoms. A more comprehensive assessment would be needed to make a definitive diagnosis.",2,"The response says the person is “somewhat coherent” but also “may not be delivering an entirely organized speech,” is “somewhat disorganized,” and is talking about a topic “not directly related” to what they were asked.

Additionally, the subject's speech was not clear and coherent, with pauses and hesitations, which could be indicative of motor symptoms commonly associated with Parkinson's disease. The subject's facial expressions were not consistent, with a mix of smiles and frowns, which could also be a sign of dyskinesia, a side effect of medication for Parkinson's disease. The subject's posture and gait appeared to be affected, with a shuffling walk, which is a common gait disturbance in Parkinson's disease. The background was not well-lit, which could have made it difficult to observe the subject's facial expressions and body language clearly. Overall, the video suggests that the subject may be experiencing symptoms of Parkinson's disease, but a definitive diagnosis would require a more comprehensive assessment by a medical professional.",1,"The response explicitly states that “The subject in the video was not following the task instructions properly” and describes clear deviations (talking about politics instead of the requested topics).

So he bent down and started the grass in front of him on fire and called for his men to come and stand in this fire. And they thought he was crazy. And they tried to run the fire.

Transcript:  Linus book that I read was called The Devil Never Sweep, subtitled How to Survive Catastrophies. Don't remember the author's name, but it was a book generally just like it says How to Survive Catastrophies. I'm interested in this area because I belong to a certain program of community emergency response team. And also when I was working, I was working in doing a lot of safety and disaster plans, etc. So there were a couple of things in this book that I had first hand knowledge about. And one was this fire that was in Missoula, Montana, back in the 40s, late 40s, early 50s, where fire jumpers parachuted into this area. And as it turned out, sadly most of them died, but the leader spent down. He saw the fire coming. He saw that they were trapped. He understood what to do. So he bent down and started the grass in front of him on fire and called for his men to come and stand in this fire. And they thought he was crazy. And they tried to run the fire. What happened was once the grass burned, then the forest fire that was coming went around this area. And so he was actually saved. Whereas there were only two other people that survived, that were that managed to get to the top of a ridge. But he was he was court-martial in the beginning, but they found that he didn't do anything wrong. And they said, altered some of their forest fire fighting techniques. Because of this. And it was called escape fire.

Transcript:  Last night I watched John Oliver, what is it called last week tonight. I believe his name is Joe, I missed John Oliver while he was a writer's strike. For the past five months and I'll talk shows have been off and I certainly felt an affinity for them being a member of the writer's field myself. So it was nice to see something back on in the reminder of the success of the strike. And John Oliver paid homage to the writers several times and then went through what we've missed in the last five months, which was quite a bit. But he of course picked out things that were very quirky and unique and very funny and then went on to his usual horrific subject. A horrific subject that society have, society's ills that we need to correct so but it was a very good show.

So you can make decisions in the matter of a blank. Like for example, they talked about he gave an example of a fireman who ran into a building and his instinctive men's thoughts say run out now and he ran out the building and the building exploded. It was because in that blink of a second all of its experience told him what he was feeling surrounding him, he better leave is going to explode. So you can use this technique in any decision. For example, my wife asked me a question, do you like this? I said yes, or I said no. And she said you didn't even give it a thought. I said yes, I did. I blanked it. You know what you know because of your past experiences. So don't take forever like a girl. Well, say don't take forever to make a decision. He did this experiment against scientists who took five years to make a decision and they came up with the same decision. He did, he came up with one decision and he waited five years for them to finish the experiment to see what they would have and they came up with the same thing. You can blink it if you have experience. If you have 40 offered experience, anything you could blink to answer because you know it. That's what I learned from the book, Link.

The one woman becomes obsessed with the other woman. And she's married to a much older man. She has a daughter that is left ran away. And then she has another daughter that lacks herself in the room and never comes out. They put her food outside the door and she just grabs her food and she will not eat anything but mashed up food. It's very strange and creepy but she comes obsessed with this other woman and who is a type of a journalist and who was telling her story. And she finds that the woman is like taking little trinkets of hers and going through a garbage to pick out certain things. So very strange and eerie and it ends with the woman, the obsessed woman killing the other's husband and that's really about it. It's just very odd movie. Book, sorry.

Transcript:  One of my favorite movies, which is a pretty old movie, was called Shawshank Redemption. One of the reasons that I liked it so much was that it has something of everything. It has love, it has suspense, it has unfairness, it has friendship, it has a great ending, and lots of unexpected things throughout the whole show. Some of the key characters were Tim Robbins, who was the main character and the prisoner who was imprisoned falsely, and Morgan Freeman, who is not only his close friendship in prison, but Morgan Freeman also narrates the story, which he is a beautiful narrator. And the story starts off with Timothy Robbins being accused of murdering his wife, and the rest of the movie is all about the things that go on in a typical prison, along with a great ending where he escapes from prison, and ends up with Morgan Freeman, and meeting him in Mexico for hopefully a wonderful life together for the end of their lives.

And there's some things that happen in the connection of 1911 such as a triangle shirt waist fire that he observes as a photographer. And she observes the fire that burns down Coney Island and they get together and become lovers after a period of time when they are seeking each other.

Transcript:  I recently read a book called The Museum of Extraordinary Things by Alice Hoffman. It's a story about a young woman who lives in a home on Coney Island with her reported father, her father who runs a freak show at Coney Island. And she lives there and observes what's going on. This is around 1911. At the same time, there's a young man who's an immigrant from Eastern Europe who lives in Manhattan. And he separates from his father and they eventually find each other. And there's some things that happen in the connection of 1911 such as a triangle shirt waist fire that he observes as a photographer. And she observes the fire that burns down Coney Island and they get together and become lovers after a period of time when they are seeking each other.

Transcript:  The most recent book that I've read is called EBSOLUTION by Alice McDermott. It's basically a story primarily about two women in Saigon, Vietnam in 1963. Both women are American wives of people's, their husbands are, I believe, in construction, their construction engineers. And it just shows the, to me, strange way that women interacted with their husbands. They had to basically pair at their husbands philosophies or if they didn't pair at their philosophies. They had to go around quietly and do their own thing sometimes without being very effective.

Question: Is the subject coherent in what they are speaking?

They are delivering a story about two women in Saigon, Vietnam in 1963, and their husbands who were construction engineers. The speech is not overly disorganized, and the person seems to be able to speak clearly and follow the topic. However, there are some pauses and hesitations in the speech, which could be indicative of potential motor or speech issues associated with Parkinson's disease. The person's facial expressions and body language are not overly exaggerated, which is a positive sign. The background is well-lit, and the person is facing the camera, which is good for assessing their movements and facial expressions. Overall, the video seems to be a good source for observing potential symptoms of Parkinson's disease, but more information would be needed to make a definitive diagnosis.",4,"The response explicitly states that the subject “appears to be coherent,” is “delivering a story” that is “not overly disorganized,” and “seems to be able to speak clearly and follow the topic.” These points strongly support the idea that the speech is coherent, understandable, and focused. The mention of “some pauses and hesitations” suggests minor issues but not major detours or disorganization. Overall, the alignment with the new statement is high, with only slight reservations.

Transcript:  I recently read a book called Lady of the Lock and it was a book about modern day twin sisters who became caretakers of an old castle in Scotland. The book alternated between the modern day twin sisters and a character who actually lived in the castle during the 1300s. They were trying to find out why the castle was haunted and who might have been haunting it. So they were alternating between going back in time and telling the story as it was happening and having the twin sisters dig and discover the history of the castle. It was a book I would recommend. It was a quick read and described Scotland and its countryside very well. The cold and the windy conditions of the castle I enjoyed it.

He describes the things that are different about the environment, in Maine, where it's a big city of urban, it's probably, if you will, it isn't in these coasts. It's really kind of neat. It comes about a lot of things that people don't realize the police officers have to get you to have to deal with every day. And a lot of them are funny and so-so and so on. They're not so funny. It's an interesting book and I think that if you can see it's a reading, it's a reading. It's actually kind of the author and it's just neat. Yeah, he's taking care of it.

They are front-facing the camera and their face is visible in the recording frame, which is good for assessing their facial expressions and any potential symptoms of Parkinson's disease. The background is not too dark or overlit, and there is good contrast against the person's face, allowing for a clear view of their features. The subject is speaking for approximately one minute, which is the duration specified in the task instructions. However, there are some noises in the background that could potentially be distracting or interfere with the assessment of Parkinson's disease symptoms. Additionally, the subject's speech is somewhat unclear and may not be easily understood due to the background noise. The subject's compliance with the task instructions is good, but the quality of the recording and the presence of background noise could make it difficult to accurately assess their speech and facial movements for any signs of Parkinson's disease.",5,"The rater states that “The subject in the video appears to be following the task instructions” and notes they are front-facing, visible, speaking for the specified duration, and talking about the requested topic. The only issues mentioned concern recording quality and background noise, not deviations from the instructions themselves. Thus, the response indicates full compliance with the task instructions.

Let me see if I can remember any of the movie. Wow, it really is difficult to remember. I don't know. I'm struggling greatly remembering something to say here. I don't know. I guess I'm just rambling on for the minute. I hope this doesn't hurt this. Thank you.

Question: Please indicate whether the subject was able to follow the instructions while completing the task. If the subject was doing something differently, please describe.",LlaVANext_SFT,"The subject in the video was not able to follow the instructions properly. Instead of speaking about a recent book or movie, they spoke about their difficulty in remembering and rambling for a minute. This deviation from the task instructions suggests that the person may have some cognitive impairment or memory issues, which could be indicative of Parkinson's disease or another neurological condition. Additionally, the subject's struggle to remember and their rambling speech may be associated with the disease. The lack of expert supervision and the presence of noise in the recording may have contributed to the difficulty in following instructions accurately.",1,"The response explicitly states that the subject ""was not able to follow the instructions properly"" and describes clear deviations from the task (talking about difficulty remembering and rambling instead of discussing a recent book or movie). This directly contradicts the statement that the subject followed all instructions accurately with no deviations.

Therefore, the appropriate rating is 1 (strongly disagree).

**Likert Score: 1**",The subject followed all instructions accurately while completing the task (no deviationsobserved).

Now, you are watching a home-recorded video of a person performing some tasks used to assess Parkinson's disease. No experts supervise the person, so there can be different types of noise, or the person may not follow the task instructions properly. The person can also show symptoms that may be associated with having Parkinson's disease. Focus on the noises, task instructions, user compliance, and possible symptoms of Parkinson's disease while answering the question.

Task instructions: The person will talk about a recent book they have read or a movie or TV show they have watched. The person will speak for approximately one minute. They should be front-facing the camera, and their face must be visible in the recording frame. There should not be any other person visible in the recording frame. The background should not be dark or overlit and should have good contrast against the person's face. For this task, the face is the most crucial body part you should focus on. However, you should also observe other body parts for relevant symptoms or signs of Parkinson's disease.

Answer the question about what is happening in the video. Keep your response short and precise.

Question: Indicate the extent of lips parting when the subject is not saying anything (i.e., always/most of the times/sometimes/very few times/never).",LlaVANext_SFT,The lips parting is always visible in the video.,1,"The response states: “The lips parting is always visible in the video,” which means the subject’s lips are consistently parted when not speaking.  

The new statement says: “The subject’s lips are never parted when not speaking.” This is the opposite of “always visible” lip parting. Therefore, the response strongly contradicts the new statement.

**Likert Score: 1**","The subject’s lips are never parted when not speaking (e.g., closed or slightly parted most ofthe time)."

Question: Indicate which of the following are true for the subject: (i) The individual's face appears blank and emotionless, even when they are trying to express an emotion. (ii) The expression is weak or asymmetrical, and the individual has difficulty holding an expression (e.g., smile) for an extended period. Also mention if you observe other facial expression abnormalities.

(ii) The expression is weak or asymmetrical, and the individual has difficulty holding an expression (e.g., smile) for an extended period. Other facial expression abnormalities include a possible tremor or dyskinesia.",1,"The response explicitly endorses both abnormalities listed in the OLD_QUESTION: a blank/emotionless face and weak/asymmetrical expressions with difficulty sustaining them. It also adds other abnormalities (tremor or dyskinesia). This directly contradicts the NEW_QUESTION, which describes natural, emotionally appropriate, and symmetrical expressions without such issues. Therefore, alignment is very low.

**Likert Score: 1**","The subject’s facial expressions are natural, emotionally appropriate, and symmetrical (noblank/emotionless face, weakness, asymmetry, or difficulty holding expressions)."

Question: Provide a brief description of the subject's perceived state of mind, noting whether they appear energetic, exhausted, calm, confused, or exhibit any other relevant emotional or cognitive cues.",LlaVANext_SFT,The subject appears to be calm and focused while speaking about a recent book they have read.,5,"The response explicitly states the subject is ""calm and focused,"" which aligns well with ""calm and alert"" in the new question (focus implies alertness). It does not mention any signs of exhaustion, confusion, or inappropriate energy, and nothing in the description contradicts their absence.
