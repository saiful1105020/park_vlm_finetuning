The person can also show symptoms that may be associated with having Parkinson's disease. Focus on the noises, task instructions, user compliance, and possible symptoms of Parkinson's disease while answering the question.

Task instructions: The person will talk about a recent book they have read or a movie or TV show they have watched. The person will speak for approximately one minute. They should be front-facing the camera, and their face must be visible in the recording frame. There should not be any other person visible in the recording frame. The background should not be dark or overlit and should have good contrast against the person's face. For this task, the face is the most crucial body part you should focus on. However, you should also observe other body parts for relevant symptoms or signs of Parkinson's disease.

Answer the question about what is happening in the video. Keep your response short and precise.

This directly supports the ""calm and alert"" part of the new question, since being focused implies alertness. While the response does not explicitly mention absence of exhaustion, confusion, or inappropriate energy, there is no indication of any such issues, and ""calm and focused"" is generally inconsistent with those problems. Overall, the alignment is strong though not fully explicit on all elements.

The new question describes someone who is calm and alert with *no signs of exhaustion*. Because the response contradicts this key part (no exhaustion), it does not align well with the new statement, though it does not mention confusion or inappropriate energy.

Given this partial but mostly negative alignment, the appropriate rating is 2 (disagree).

**Likert Score: 2**",3,"The old response only states that the subject is ""calm."" This directly supports the ""appears calm"" part of the new question but says nothing about being alert or about the absence of exhaustion, confusion, or inappropriate energy levels. Since we cannot assume these additional aspects from the single word ""calm,"" the alignment is partial rather than complete.

**Likert Score: 3**",1,"The response ""anxious"" indicates the subject is experiencing heightened anxiety, which conflicts with being calm and showing no inappropriate energy levels. Anxiety typically implies emotional unease and possible agitation, not calmness. Therefore, the response does not align with the positive statement in the new question.

Transcript:  I recently read a book called Tomorrow and Tomorrow and Tomorrow, which is really about a book about cultural differences in individuals, but it's demonstrated through the design of video games, through an MIT and Harvard students who have gotten together prior in their lives and then met up subsequently at these two very prestigious schools. They moved back and forth in the book between the East and West Coast because they originally came from the West Coast and one of them is Asian descent, the other is biracial. And so meeting all their friends and experiencing their lives was very interesting to me and understanding actually about the creation of video games, which I thought was quite interesting since I didn't know anything about it.

However, they may be deterred from the central topic of the book and may not be delivering an entirely organized speech. The person's speech may be somewhat disorganized, as they are discussing a topic that is not directly related to the book they were asked to talk about. This could be a sign of cognitive impairment or difficulty in focusing on the task at hand. It is important to note that the presence of such symptoms alone does not necessarily indicate Parkinson's disease, as other neurological conditions or cognitive impairments can also cause similar symptoms. A more comprehensive assessment would be needed to make a definitive diagnosis.",2,"The response says the person is “somewhat coherent” but also “may not be delivering an entirely organized speech,” is “somewhat disorganized,” and is talking about a topic “not directly related” to what they were asked.

Transcript:  Linus book that I read was called The Devil Never Sweep, subtitled How to Survive Catastrophies. Don't remember the author's name, but it was a book generally just like it says How to Survive Catastrophies. I'm interested in this area because I belong to a certain program of community emergency response team. And also when I was working, I was working in doing a lot of safety and disaster plans, etc. So there were a couple of things in this book that I had first hand knowledge about. And one was this fire that was in Missoula, Montana, back in the 40s, late 40s, early 50s, where fire jumpers parachuted into this area. And as it turned out, sadly most of them died, but the leader spent down. He saw the fire coming. He saw that they were trapped. He understood what to do. So he bent down and started the grass in front of him on fire and called for his men to come and stand in this fire. And they thought he was crazy. And they tried to run the fire. What happened was once the grass burned, then the forest fire that was coming went around this area. And so he was actually saved. Whereas there were only two other people that survived, that were that managed to get to the top of a ridge. But he was he was court-martial in the beginning, but they found that he didn't do anything wrong. And they said, altered some of their forest fire fighting techniques. Because of this.

I'm interested in this area because I belong to a certain program of community emergency response team. And also when I was working, I was working in doing a lot of safety and disaster plans, etc. So there were a couple of things in this book that I had first hand knowledge about. And one was this fire that was in Missoula, Montana, back in the 40s, late 40s, early 50s, where fire jumpers parachuted into this area. And as it turned out, sadly most of them died, but the leader spent down. He saw the fire coming. He saw that they were trapped. He understood what to do. So he bent down and started the grass in front of him on fire and called for his men to come and stand in this fire. And they thought he was crazy. And they tried to run the fire. What happened was once the grass burned, then the forest fire that was coming went around this area. And so he was actually saved. Whereas there were only two other people that survived, that were that managed to get to the top of a ridge. But he was he was court-martial in the beginning, but they found that he didn't do anything wrong. And they said, altered some of their forest fire fighting techniques. Because of this. And it was called escape fire.

Transcript:  Last night I watched John Oliver, what is it called last week tonight. I believe his name is Joe, I missed John Oliver while he was a writer's strike. For the past five months and I'll talk shows have been off and I certainly felt an affinity for them being a member of the writer's field myself. So it was nice to see something back on in the reminder of the success of the strike. And John Oliver paid homage to the writers several times and then went through what we've missed in the last five months, which was quite a bit. But he of course picked out things that were very quirky and unique and very funny and then went on to his usual horrific subject. A horrific subject that society have, society's ills that we need to correct so but it was a very good show.

Transcript:  Last night I watched John Oliver, what is it called last week tonight. I believe his name is Joe, I missed John Oliver while he was a writer's strike. For the past five months and I'll talk shows have been off and I certainly felt an affinity for them being a member of the writer's field myself. So it was nice to see something back on in the reminder of the success of the strike. And John Oliver paid homage to the writers several times and then went through what we've missed in the last five months, which was quite a bit. But he of course picked out things that were very quirky and unique and very funny and then went on to his usual horrific subject. A horrific subject that society have, society's ills that we need to correct so but it was a very good show.

Transcript:  I would like to talk about the book Blake. I'm not going to get anywhere. One of my favorite authors, he talks about your mind and your experiences accumulate. So you can make decisions in the matter of a blank. Like for example, they talked about he gave an example of a fireman who ran into a building and his instinctive men's thoughts say run out now and he ran out the building and the building exploded. It was because in that blink of a second all of its experience told him what he was feeling surrounding him, he better leave is going to explode. So you can use this technique in any decision. For example, my wife asked me a question, do you like this? I said yes, or I said no. And she said you didn't even give it a thought. I said yes, I did. I blanked it. You know what you know because of your past experiences. So don't take forever like a girl. Well, say don't take forever to make a decision. He did this experiment against scientists who took five years to make a decision and they came up with the same decision. He did, he came up with one decision and he waited five years for them to finish the experiment to see what they would have and they came up with the same thing. You can blink it if you have experience. If you have 40 offered experience, anything you could blink to answer because you know it. That's what I learned from the book, Link.

Transcript:  I would like to talk about the book Blake. I'm not going to get anywhere. One of my favorite authors, he talks about your mind and your experiences accumulate. So you can make decisions in the matter of a blank. Like for example, they talked about he gave an example of a fireman who ran into a building and his instinctive men's thoughts say run out now and he ran out the building and the building exploded. It was because in that blink of a second all of its experience told him what he was feeling surrounding him, he better leave is going to explode. So you can use this technique in any decision. For example, my wife asked me a question, do you like this? I said yes, or I said no. And she said you didn't even give it a thought. I said yes, I did. I blanked it. You know what you know because of your past experiences. So don't take forever like a girl. Well, say don't take forever to make a decision. He did this experiment against scientists who took five years to make a decision and they came up with the same decision. He did, he came up with one decision and he waited five years for them to finish the experiment to see what they would have and they came up with the same thing. You can blink it if you have experience. If you have 40 offered experience, anything you could blink to answer because you know it. That's what I learned from the book, Link.

Transcript:  The most recent book I read was called None of This is True. And it was about a woman who met another woman that they had the same exact birthdays and they were in the hospital at the same time together. They were born in the same hospital. The one woman becomes obsessed with the other woman. And she's married to a much older man. She has a daughter that is left ran away. And then she has another daughter that lacks herself in the room and never comes out. They put her food outside the door and she just grabs her food and she will not eat anything but mashed up food. It's very strange and creepy but she comes obsessed with this other woman and who is a type of a journalist and who was telling her story. And she finds that the woman is like taking little trinkets of hers and going through a garbage to pick out certain things. So very strange and eerie and it ends with the woman, the obsessed woman killing the other's husband and that's really about it. It's just very odd movie. Book, sorry.

Question: Is the subject coherent in what they are speaking? Are they delivering an easy to understand story, or are they deterring a lot from the central topic and delivering an unorganized speech?",LlaVANext_SFT,"The subject appears to be coherent in their speech, delivering a story that is somewhat organized and easy to understand. However, there are some deviations from the central topic, such as the mention of a movie or TV show that is not related to the book they are discussing. This could be a sign of cognitive impairment or a symptom of Parkinson's disease, which may affect the ability to stay on topic. The subject's speech is not overly disorganized, but there are some meandering elements that could be indicative of a movement disorder. It is important to observe the person's overall body language, facial expressions, and any involuntary movements to assess for any potential symptoms of Parkinson's disease.",3,"The response says the subject is “coherent,” “somewhat organized and easy to understand,” but also notes “some deviations from the central topic” and “meandering elements.” This indicates partial coherence and focus, but not fully staying on topic without detours.

Transcript:  The most recent book I read was called None of This is True. And it was about a woman who met another woman that they had the same exact birthdays and they were in the hospital at the same time together. They were born in the same hospital. The one woman becomes obsessed with the other woman. And she's married to a much older man. She has a daughter that is left ran away. And then she has another daughter that lacks herself in the room and never comes out. They put her food outside the door and she just grabs her food and she will not eat anything but mashed up food. It's very strange and creepy but she comes obsessed with this other woman and who is a type of a journalist and who was telling her story. And she finds that the woman is like taking little trinkets of hers and going through a garbage to pick out certain things. So very strange and eerie and it ends with the woman, the obsessed woman killing the other's husband and that's really about it. It's just very odd movie. Book, sorry.

Question: Please indicate whether the subject was able to follow the instructions while completing the task. If the subject was doing something differently, please describe.",LlaVANext_SFT,"The subject in the video was not following the task instructions properly. Instead of speaking about a recent book or movie/TV show they have read or watched, they started discussing a book called ""None of This is True."" Additionally, the subject's speech was not clear and coherent, which could be indicative of potential speech and language symptoms associated with Parkinson's disease. The subject's facial expressions and body language were not consistent with the content being discussed, which could be a sign of motor symptoms such as tremors or dyskinesia. The background was not well-lit, and the subject's face was not clearly visible in the recording frame, which could be a sign of poor lighting or camera angle. The subject's focus was not on the camera, and they were not front-facing the camera, which is essential for a proper assessment of Parkinson's disease. The subject's overall demeanor and behavior during the task were not consistent with a typical patient, which could be a sign of cognitive or behavioral symptoms associated with Parkinson's disease.",1,"The rater explicitly states that the subject ""was not following the task instructions properly"" and describes multiple deviations (talking about the wrong content, unclear speech, poor camera focus, not front-facing, etc.).

Transcript:  One of my favorite movies, which is a pretty old movie, was called Shawshank Redemption. One of the reasons that I liked it so much was that it has something of everything. It has love, it has suspense, it has unfairness, it has friendship, it has a great ending, and lots of unexpected things throughout the whole show. Some of the key characters were Tim Robbins, who was the main character and the prisoner who was imprisoned falsely, and Morgan Freeman, who is not only his close friendship in prison, but Morgan Freeman also narrates the story, which he is a beautiful narrator. And the story starts off with Timothy Robbins being accused of murdering his wife, and the rest of the movie is all about the things that go on in a typical prison, along with a great ending where he escapes from prison, and ends up with Morgan Freeman, and meeting him in Mexico for hopefully a wonderful life together for the end of their lives.

Analyze the provided text transcription of the person’s speech and answer the question about what is happening in the video.

Transcript:  One of my favorite movies, which is a pretty old movie, was called Shawshank Redemption. One of the reasons that I liked it so much was that it has something of everything. It has love, it has suspense, it has unfairness, it has friendship, it has a great ending, and lots of unexpected things throughout the whole show. Some of the key characters were Tim Robbins, who was the main character and the prisoner who was imprisoned falsely, and Morgan Freeman, who is not only his close friendship in prison, but Morgan Freeman also narrates the story, which he is a beautiful narrator. And the story starts off with Timothy Robbins being accused of murdering his wife, and the rest of the movie is all about the things that go on in a typical prison, along with a great ending where he escapes from prison, and ends up with Morgan Freeman, and meeting him in Mexico for hopefully a wonderful life together for the end of their lives.

Question: Is the subject coherent in what they are speaking?

Additionally, the subject's facial expressions and body language may show signs of rigidity, tremors, or other motor symptoms associated with the disease.

Transcript:  I recently read a book called The Museum of Extraordinary Things by Alice Hoffman. It's a story about a young woman who lives in a home on Coney Island with her reported father, her father who runs a freak show at Coney Island. And she lives there and observes what's going on. This is around 1911. At the same time, there's a young man who's an immigrant from Eastern Europe who lives in Manhattan. And he separates from his father and they eventually find each other. And there's some things that happen in the connection of 1911 such as a triangle shirt waist fire that he observes as a photographer. And she observes the fire that burns down Coney Island and they get together and become lovers after a period of time when they are seeking each other.

It's a story about a young woman who lives in a home on Coney Island with her reported father, her father who runs a freak show at Coney Island. And she lives there and observes what's going on. This is around 1911. At the same time, there's a young man who's an immigrant from Eastern Europe who lives in Manhattan. And he separates from his father and they eventually find each other. And there's some things that happen in the connection of 1911 such as a triangle shirt waist fire that he observes as a photographer. And she observes the fire that burns down Coney Island and they get together and become lovers after a period of time when they are seeking each other.

It's about common things that you and I may want to buy for our house. So, it's interesting. It's whatever you might want to think about. Today they had a 1923 Buick. I'm trying to think of what it is. It was a cap for the radiator cap. It's interesting how I'm losing track of things like this. You would think that I wouldn't have a problem with remembering something like that, but I do.

The person can also show symptoms that may be associated with having Parkinson's disease. Focus on the noises, task instructions, user compliance, and possible symptoms of Parkinson's disease while answering the question.

Task instructions: The person will talk about a recent book they have read or a movie or TV show they have watched. The person will speak for approximately one minute. They should be front-facing the camera, and their face must be visible in the recording frame. There should not be any other person visible in the recording frame. The background should not be dark or overlit and should have good contrast against the person's face. For this task, the face is the most crucial body part you should focus on. However, you should also observe other body parts for relevant symptoms or signs of Parkinson's disease.

Answer the question about what is happening in the video. Keep your response short and precise.

Question: How far is the camera? A good position of the camera would be when the upper half of the subject's body remains visible, while the lower half is not captured in the frame.

If the lower body is also visible, the camera is too far.",LlaVANext_SFT,The camera is positioned at a good distance to capture the upper half of the subject's body while maintaining a clear view of the face and avoiding any distractions from the background.,5,"The response explicitly states that “the camera is positioned at a good distance to capture the upper half of the subject's body,” which directly matches the NEW_QUESTION’s criterion that the upper half is visible. Although it doesn’t explicitly mention that the lower half is not captured, the description of this as a “good distance” in the context of the OLD_QUESTION implies that the lower half is indeed out of frame.

Transcript:  We've been watching a, we've been married and I have been watching a TV series on PBS called Profilash which I guess translates to the Paris murders. It's a very interesting show. It's a one hour program. They, for most part, complete the investigation of murder. We have two things going on, two different tasks going on during the program.

It's Chloe Saint-Lauron and she's, I believe on the autistic scale somewhere. She's a very strange individual. Address is strangely, extremely, but she's apparently quite brilliant because she gives insights that help them to solve the various program murders that they have to, they've encountered.

They are discussing the show's plot and the character Chloe Saint-Lauron, who is described as being on the autistic spectrum. The speech is not entirely unorganized, but there are some digressions and repetitions that may indicate some difficulty in maintaining focus or organization. The subject's speech is clear enough to understand, but there are some moments where they may not be following the task instructions properly, such as when they mention the translation of the show's title and the character's autism. The background is not overly dark or overlit, and the subject's face is visible in the recording frame, which is good for assessing their facial expressions and body language. However, the video quality is not optimal, and there is some background noise that could be distracting. Overall, the subject's compliance with the task instructions is mixed, and there are some signs of Parkinson's disease that could be observed in their speech and body language, such as tremors or slowed movements.",3,"The response notes that the subject is ""coherent"" and ""clear enough to understand,"" and that the story is ""somewhat related to the topic.""

Transcript:  We've been watching a, we've been married and I have been watching a TV series on PBS called Profilash which I guess translates to the Paris murders. It's a very interesting show. It's a one hour program. They, for most part, complete the investigation of murder. We have two things going on, two different tasks going on during the program. You know, start to investigate the murder and of course solve it within an hour. The interesting part to me is the one of the main characters was a young lady. It's in French with French sub titles. It's Chloe Saint-Lauron and she's, I believe on the autistic scale somewhere. She's a very strange individual. Address is strangely, extremely, but she's apparently quite brilliant because she gives insights that help them to solve the various program murders that they have to, they've encountered.

Transcript:  The most recent book that I've read is called EBSOLUTION by Alice McDermott. It's basically a story primarily about two women in Saigon, Vietnam in 1963. Both women are American wives of people's, their husbands are, I believe, in construction, their construction engineers. And it just shows the, to me, strange way that women interacted with their husbands. They had to basically pair at their husbands philosophies or if they didn't pair at their philosophies. They had to go around quietly and do their own thing sometimes without being very effective.

Question: Is the subject coherent in what they are speaking? Are they delivering an easy to understand story, or are they deterring a lot from the central topic and delivering an unorganized speech?",LlaVANext_SFT,"The subject appears to be coherent in their speech, as they are discussing a recent book they have read. They are delivering a story about two women in Saigon, Vietnam in 1963, and their husbands who were construction engineers. The speech is not overly disorganized, and the person seems to be able to speak clearly and follow the topic. However, there are some pauses and hesitations in the speech, which could be indicative of potential motor or speech issues associated with Parkinson's disease. The person's facial expressions and body language are not overly exaggerated, which is a positive sign. The background is well-lit, and the person is facing the camera, which is good for assessing their movements and facial expressions. Overall, the video seems to be a good source for observing potential symptoms of Parkinson's disease, but more information would be needed to make a definitive diagnosis.",4,"The response explicitly states that the subject “appears to be coherent,” is “delivering a story” that is “not overly disorganized,” and “seems to be able to speak clearly and follow the topic.” These points strongly support the idea that the speech is coherent, understandable, and focused.

Transcript:  The most recent book that I've read is called EBSOLUTION by Alice McDermott. It's basically a story primarily about two women in Saigon, Vietnam in 1963. Both women are American wives of people's, their husbands are, I believe, in construction, their construction engineers. And it just shows the, to me, strange way that women interacted with their husbands. They had to basically pair at their husbands philosophies or if they didn't pair at their philosophies. They had to go around quietly and do their own thing sometimes without being very effective.

Transcript:  I recently read a book called Lady of the Lock and it was a book about modern day twin sisters who became caretakers of an old castle in Scotland. The book alternated between the modern day twin sisters and a character who actually lived in the castle during the 1300s. They were trying to find out why the castle was haunted and who might have been haunting it. So they were alternating between going back in time and telling the story as it was happening and having the twin sisters dig and discover the history of the castle. It was a book I would recommend. It was a quick read and described Scotland and its countryside very well. The cold and the windy conditions of the castle I enjoyed it.

Question: Is the subject coherent in what they are speaking? Are they delivering an easy to understand story, or are they deterring a lot from the central topic and delivering an unorganized speech?",LlaVANext_SFT,"The subject appears to be coherent in their speech, delivering a story that is easy to understand.

Given the old question contrasts coherent, easy-to-follow speech with unorganized, off-topic speech, the respondent’s choice of “coherent” clearly indicates they see the subject’s speech as organized and understandable.

Transcript:  I recently read a book called Lady of the Lock and it was a book about modern day twin sisters who became caretakers of an old castle in Scotland. The book alternated between the modern day twin sisters and a character who actually lived in the castle during the 1300s. They were trying to find out why the castle was haunted and who might have been haunting it. So they were alternating between going back in time and telling the story as it was happening and having the twin sisters dig and discover the history of the castle. It was a book I would recommend. It was a quick read and described Scotland and its countryside very well. The cold and the windy conditions of the castle I enjoyed it.

The person can also show symptoms that may be associated with having Parkinson's disease. Focus on the noises, task instructions, user compliance, and possible symptoms of Parkinson's disease while answering the question.

Task instructions: The person will talk about a recent book they have read or a movie or TV show they have watched. The person will speak for approximately one minute. They should be front-facing the camera, and their face must be visible in the recording frame. There should not be any other person visible in the recording frame. The background should not be dark or overlit and should have good contrast against the person's face. For this task, the face is the most crucial body part you should focus on. However, you should also observe other body parts for relevant symptoms or signs of Parkinson's disease.

He describes the things that are different about the environment, in Maine, where it's a big city of urban, it's probably, if you will, it isn't in these coasts. It's really kind of neat.

It's an interesting book and I think that if you can see it's a reading, it's a reading. It's actually kind of the author and it's just neat. Yeah, he's taking care of it.

- “never at rest” suggests the subject is not in a true resting (not speaking) state, so the observer cannot determine how often the lips are parted at rest.  
- “unable to assess” explicitly indicates that no judgment about lip parting can be made.

Transcript:  I am currently reading a book called The Detective Inventory Art. It's really an interesting book. It's about the reflections of a main police officer. This man came up from some places in New York, New Jersey area, and he retired in Maine as a policeman. He describes the things that are different about the environment, in Maine, where it's a big city of urban, it's probably, if you will, it isn't in these coasts. It's really kind of neat. It comes about a lot of things that people don't realize the police officers have to get you to have to deal with every day. And a lot of them are funny and so-so and so on. They're not so funny. It's an interesting book and I think that if you can see it's a reading, it's a reading. It's actually kind of the author and it's just neat. Yeah, he's taking care of it.
