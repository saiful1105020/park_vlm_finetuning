**QUESTION:**

While it does not explicitly mention staying focused on the central topic or avoiding unorganized detours, there is no indication of any detours or disorganization, and the positive description strongly implies an organized, focused speech.

Given this strong alignment with all key aspects (coherent, easy to understand, and implicitly organized/focused), the most appropriate rating is 5.

**QUESTION:**
Question: Provide a brief description of the subject's perceived state of mind, noting whether they appear energetic, exhausted, calm, confused, or exhibit any other relevant emotional or cognitive cues.",llava_qwen,"The subject appears to be in a calm state, as indicated by their steady and composed demeanor while talking about the series they watched.",4,"The response explicitly states that the subject appears calm, supported by a “steady and composed demeanor,” which aligns well with the “calm and alert” part of the new question. However, the response does not mention alertness directly, nor does it address the absence or presence of exhaustion, confusion, or inappropriate energy levels. These additional elements are not contradicted, but simply not discussed.

Because the description strongly supports calmness but is neutral (neither confirming nor denying) on the other aspects, the best fit is moderately high agreement rather than full agreement.

**Likert Score: 4**","The subject appears calm and alert, with no signs of exhaustion, confusion, or inappropriate energy levels."

**QUESTION:**
Question: How far is the camera? A good position of the camera would be when the upper half of the subject's body remains visible, while the lower half is not captured in the frame. If the upper body is only partly visible, the camera is too close. If the lower body is also visible, the camera is too far.",llava_qwen,The camera is at a good position.,5,"The old response directly states: “The camera is at a good position.”  

Given the old question’s definition of a “good position” (upper half visible, lower half not visible), this response implies agreement that the camera distance matches that description. There is no indication of disagreement or uncertainty.

Therefore, the response strongly aligns with the new positive statement.

**Likert Score: 5**","The camera distance is appropriate, with the upper half of the subject’s body visible and thelower half not captured."

The mention of ""no significant changes in their facial expressions or body language"" suggests stability and no obvious signs of distress, exhaustion, or inappropriate energy.

However, the response does not explicitly address alertness or rule out confusion; it simply notes calmness and composure. Still, there is no indication of exhaustion, confusion, or abnormal energy levels.

Overall, the alignment is good but not complete due to the missing explicit reference to alertness.

**Likert Score: 4**","The subject appears calm and alert, with no signs of exhaustion, confusion, or inappropriate energy levels."

The mention of ""no significant changes in their facial expressions or body language"" suggests stability and no obvious signs of exhaustion, confusion, or inappropriate energy levels. However, the response does not explicitly address ""alertness,"" so that part is only weakly implied rather than confirmed.

Overall, the alignment is strong but not complete due to the missing explicit indication of alertness.

**QUESTION:**
Question: How far is the camera? A good position of the camera would be when the upper half of the subject's body remains visible, while the lower half is not captured in the frame. If the upper body is only partly visible, the camera is too close. If the lower body is also visible, the camera is too far.",llava_qwen,The camera is at a good position.,5,"The old response explicitly states: “The camera is at a good position,” directly addressing the old question’s definition of a good position (upper half visible, lower half not). This aligns fully with the new positive statement that the camera distance is appropriate in exactly that way.

Therefore, the response strongly agrees with the NEW_QUESTION.

**Likert Score: 5**","The camera distance is appropriate, with the upper half of the subject’s body visible and thelower half not captured."

**QUESTION:**
Question: Indicate which of the following are true for the subject: (i) The individual's face appears blank and emotionless, even when they are trying to express an emotion. (ii) The expression is weak or asymmetrical, and the individual has difficulty holding an expression (e.g., smile) for an extended period. Also mention if you observe other facial expression abnormalities."".",llava_qwen,"(i) The individual's face appears blank and emotionless, even when they are trying to express an emotion.",1,"The old response explicitly endorses that the individual's face appears blank and emotionless, even when trying to express emotion. This directly contradicts the new statement, which describes natural, emotionally appropriate expressions without a blank/emotionless appearance. Therefore, the alignment with the new question is very low.

**Likert Score: 1**","The subject’s facial expressions are natural, emotionally appropriate, and symmetrical (noblank/emotionless face, weakness, asymmetry, or difficulty holding expressions)."

Question: Provide a brief description of the subject's perceived state of mind, noting whether they appear energetic, exhausted, calm, confused, or exhibit any other relevant emotional or cognitive cues.",llava_qwen,"The subject appears to be in a calm and composed state, with no significant changes in their emotional or cognitive state throughout the video.",4,"The old response states the subject is ""calm and composed"" with ""no significant changes in their emotional or cognitive state."" This directly supports the ""calm"" aspect and suggests stability without signs of confusion or exhaustion. While ""alert"" is not explicitly mentioned, the absence of emotional or cognitive changes implies no obvious impairment or inappropriate energy levels. Overall, the response aligns well with the new statement, though not perfectly on the ""alert"" detail.

**Likert Score: 4**","The subject appears calm and alert, with no signs of exhaustion, confusion, or inappropriate energy levels."

**QUESTION:**
Question: Indicate if any body part critical for this task is partially visible (or invisible). For example, was the subject wearing a mask that may have obstructed important visual information? Or did the face go out of frame while the subject was completing the task?",llava_qwen,"No, the face was visible throughout the video.",5,"The old response states that “the face was visible throughout the video,” directly supporting the idea that a key critical body part (the face) remained fully visible for the entire task. There is no indication of any obstruction or partial visibility. This aligns strongly with the new statement that all critical body parts remain fully visible.

**Likert Score: 5**","All critical body parts (e.g., unobstructed face) remain fully visible in the frame throughout the task."

It also notes “no significant changes in their facial expressions or body language,” which is consistent with a stable, non-agitated state and does not suggest exhaustion, confusion, or inappropriate energy. However, the response does not explicitly mention alertness, so that part is only weakly implied rather than confirmed.

**QUESTION:**
Question: Is the subject coherent in what they are speaking? Are they delivering an easy to understand story, or are they deterring a lot from the central topic and delivering an unorganized speech?",llava_qwen,"The subject is coherent in what they are speaking, delivering an easy to understand story.",5,"The response explicitly states that “The subject is coherent in what they are speaking, delivering an easy to understand story,” which directly supports the parts of the new question about coherence and ease of understanding. While it does not explicitly mention staying focused on the central topic or avoiding unorganized detours, there is no indication of any problems in that area, and “easy to understand story” reasonably implies a focused, organized narrative.

Thus, the response strongly aligns with the new statement.

**Likert Score: 5**","The subject’s speech is coherent, easy to understand, and stays focused on the central topic(no unorganized detours)."

**QUESTION:**
Question: Indicate the extent of lips parting when the subject is not saying anything (i.e., always/most of the times/sometimes/very few times/never).",llava_qwen,Most of the times,1,"The old response “Most of the times” indicates that the subject’s lips are parted most of the time when not speaking.  

The new statement says the subject’s lips are *never* parted when not speaking (i.e., they are closed or only slightly parted most of the time). This is essentially the opposite of the old response. Therefore, the alignment is very low.

**Likert Score: 1**","The subject’s lips are never parted when not speaking (e.g., closed or slightly parted most ofthe time)."

However, it does not explicitly mention alertness or energy level (e.g., whether they are appropriately energetic vs. lethargic), so that part is only implied, not confirmed.

Given this, the alignment is good but not complete.

**QUESTION:**
Question: How far is the camera? A good position of the camera would be when the upper half of the subject's body remains visible, while the lower half is not captured in the frame. If the upper body is only partly visible, the camera is too close. If the lower body is also visible, the camera is too far.",llava_qwen,The camera is at a good position.,5,"The old response directly states: “The camera is at a good position.”  
Given the old question’s definition of a “good position” (upper half visible, lower half not), this implies full agreement with the new positive statement about appropriate camera distance.

Therefore, the response strongly aligns with the NEW_QUESTION.

**Likert Score: 5**","The camera distance is appropriate, with the upper half of the subject’s body visible and thelower half not captured."

**QUESTION:**
Question: Indicate which of the following are true for the subject: (i) The individual's face appears blank and emotionless, even when they are trying to express an emotion. (ii) The expression is weak or asymmetrical, and the individual has difficulty holding an expression (e.g., smile) for an extended period. Also mention if you observe other facial expression abnormalities."".",llava_qwen,"(i) The individual's face appears blank and emotionless, even when they are trying to express an emotion.",1,"The old response explicitly endorses that the individual's face appears blank and emotionless, even when trying to express emotion. This directly contradicts the new statement, which describes natural, emotionally appropriate expressions without a blank/emotionless appearance. Therefore, the alignment with the new question is very poor.

**Likert Score: 1**","The subject’s facial expressions are natural, emotionally appropriate, and symmetrical (noblank/emotionless face, weakness, asymmetry, or difficulty holding expressions)."

Or did the face go out of frame while the subject was completing the task?",llava_qwen,"No, the face was visible throughout the task.",5,"The old response states that “the face was visible throughout the task,” directly supporting the idea that a key critical body part (the face) remained fully visible for the entire duration.

**QUESTION:**
Question: How far is the camera? A good position of the camera would be when the upper half of the subject's body remains visible, while the lower half is not captured in the frame. If the upper body is only partly visible, the camera is too close. If the lower body is also visible, the camera is too far.",llava_qwen,The camera is at a good position.,5,"The old response directly states: “The camera is at a good position.”  
Given the old question’s definition of a “good position” (upper half visible, lower half not), this implies full agreement that the camera distance matches that criterion. There is no indication of disagreement or uncertainty.

Therefore, the response is fully aligned with the new positive statement.

**Likert Score: 5**","The camera distance is appropriate, with the upper half of the subject’s body visible and thelower half not captured."

**QUESTION:**
Question: Is the subject coherent in what they are speaking? Are they delivering an easy to understand story, or are they deterring a lot from the central topic and delivering an unorganized speech?",llava_qwen,"The subject is coherent in what they are speaking, delivering an easy to understand story.",5,"The response explicitly states that “The subject is coherent in what they are speaking, delivering an easy to understand story,” which directly supports the parts of the new question about coherence and ease of understanding. While it does not explicitly mention staying focused on the central topic or avoiding unorganized detours, there is no indication of any problems in that area, and the positive description implies an overall organized, focused speech.

Given this strong alignment with most of the statement and implied alignment with the rest, the most appropriate rating is 5.

**Likert Score: 5**","The subject’s speech is coherent, easy to understand, and stays focused on the central topic(no unorganized detours)."

However, the response does not mention alertness, nor does it explicitly rule out exhaustion or confusion. These aspects are not contradicted, just not addressed.

Overall, the alignment is positive but incomplete, so a moderately high score is appropriate.

Question: Provide a brief description of the subject's perceived state of mind, noting whether they appear energetic, exhausted, calm, confused, or exhibit any other relevant emotional or cognitive cues.",llava_qwen,"The subject appears calm and composed, with no significant changes in their facial expressions or body language throughout the video.",4,"The response explicitly states that the subject appears ""calm and composed,"" which aligns well with the ""calm"" aspect of the new question. The mention of ""no significant changes in their facial expressions or body language"" suggests stability and no obvious signs of distress or inappropriate energy.

However, the response does not explicitly address alertness, nor does it clearly rule out exhaustion or confusion; it simply notes composure and lack of change. Thus, while generally consistent with a calm, non-distressed state, it only partially supports the full statement in the new question.

A moderately high agreement is appropriate.

**Likert Score: 4**","The subject appears calm and alert, with no signs of exhaustion, confusion, or inappropriate energy levels."

**QUESTION:**
Question: How far is the camera? A good position of the camera would be when the upper half of the subject's body remains visible, while the lower half is not captured in the frame.

If the lower body is also visible, the camera is too far.",llava_qwen,The camera is at a good position.,5,"The old response directly states: “The camera is at a good position.”  
Given the old question’s definition of a “good position” (upper half visible, lower half not), this implies full agreement with the new positive statement about appropriate camera distance.

Therefore, the response strongly aligns with the NEW_QUESTION.

**Likert Score: 5**","The camera distance is appropriate, with the upper half of the subject’s body visible and thelower half not captured."

**QUESTION:**
Question: Indicate which of the following are true for the subject: (i) The individual's face appears blank and emotionless, even when they are trying to express an emotion. (ii) The expression is weak or asymmetrical, and the individual has difficulty holding an expression (e.g., smile) for an extended period. Also mention if you observe other facial expression abnormalities."".",llava_qwen,"(i) The individual's face appears blank and emotionless, even when they are trying to express an emotion.",1,"The old response explicitly endorses that the individual's face appears blank and emotionless, even when trying to express emotion. This directly contradicts the new statement, which describes natural, emotionally appropriate expressions without a blank/emotionless appearance. Therefore, the alignment with the new question is very low.

**Likert Score: 1**","The subject’s facial expressions are natural, emotionally appropriate, and symmetrical (noblank/emotionless face, weakness, asymmetry, or difficulty holding expressions)."

**QUESTION:**
Question: Provide a brief description of the subject's perceived state of mind, noting whether they appear energetic, exhausted, calm, confused, or exhibit any other relevant emotional or cognitive cues.",llava_qwen,"The subject appears to be in a calm state, with no significant changes in facial expressions or body language throughout the video.",3,"The old response clearly supports the “calm” aspect of the new statement: it explicitly says the subject appears calm and shows no significant changes in facial expressions or body language, which is consistent with emotional stability and no obvious distress.

However, the response does not mention alertness, nor does it explicitly address the absence of exhaustion, confusion, or inappropriate energy levels. These elements are not contradicted, but they are also not confirmed.

Because the response partially aligns (strongly on calmness, neutral on the rest), the best fit is a moderate agreement.

**Likert Score: 3**","The subject appears calm and alert, with no signs of exhaustion, confusion, or inappropriate energy levels."

**QUESTION:**
Question: Indicate if any body part critical for this task is partially visible (or invisible). For example, was the subject wearing a mask that may have obstructed important visual information? Or did the face go out of frame while the subject was completing the task?",llava_qwen,"No, the face is visible throughout the video.",5,"The old response states that “the face is visible throughout the video” and explicitly denies any obstruction (“No”). Since the face is the key critical body part mentioned in both the example and the new question, this directly supports the statement that all critical body parts (at least the face) remain fully visible throughout the task. There is no indication of any obstruction or partial visibility.

**Likert Score: 5**","All critical body parts (e.g., unobstructed face) remain fully visible in the frame throughout the task."

**QUESTION:**
Question: How far is the camera? A good position of the camera would be when the upper half of the subject's body remains visible, while the lower half is not captured in the frame. If the upper body is only partly visible, the camera is too close. If the lower body is also visible, the camera is too far.",llava_qwen,The camera is at a good position.,5,"The old response explicitly states: “The camera is at a good position.”  
In the context of the old question, a “good position” is clearly defined as the camera distance where the upper half of the subject’s body is visible and the lower half is not. Therefore, saying the camera is at a good position directly affirms the condition described in the new question.

**Likert Score: 5**","The camera distance is appropriate, with the upper half of the subject’s body visible and thelower half not captured."

**QUESTION:**
Question: Provide a brief description of the subject's perceived state of mind, noting whether they appear energetic, exhausted, calm, confused, or exhibit any other relevant emotional or cognitive cues.",llava_qwen,"The subject appears to be in a calm state, with no significant changes in facial expressions or body language throughout the video.",4,"The old response explicitly states that the subject appears calm and shows no significant changes in facial expressions or body language. This supports the “calm” aspect and suggests emotional stability. However, the response does not mention alertness, nor does it explicitly rule out exhaustion, confusion, or inappropriate energy levels. These additional elements are not contradicted, but they are not confirmed either.

Because the description supports calmness and implies no obvious distress but lacks explicit information about alertness and other states, the best fit is moderate-to-high agreement.

**QUESTION:**
Question: Indicate if any body part critical for this task is partially visible (or invisible). For example, was the subject wearing a mask that may have obstructed important visual information? Or did the face go out of frame while the subject was completing the task?",llava_qwen,"No, the face is visible throughout the video.",5,"The old response states that “the face is visible throughout the video” and explicitly denies any obstruction (“No”). Since the face is the key critical body part mentioned in both the example and the new question, this directly supports the statement that all critical body parts (at least the face) remain fully visible throughout the task. There is no indication of any partial visibility or obstruction.

**Likert Score: 5**","All critical body parts (e.g., unobstructed face) remain fully visible in the frame throughout the task."

**QUESTION:**
Question: How far is the camera? A good position of the camera would be when the upper half of the subject's body remains visible, while the lower half is not captured in the frame. If the upper body is only partly visible, the camera is too close. If the lower body is also visible, the camera is too far.",llava_qwen,The camera is at a good position.,5,"The old response directly states: “The camera is at a good position.”  
Given the old question’s definition of a “good position” (upper half visible, lower half not visible), this implies full agreement with the new positive statement about appropriate camera distance.

**QUESTION:**
Question: Indicate the extent of lips parting when the subject is not saying anything (i.e., always/most of the times/sometimes/very few times/never).",llava_qwen,Most of the times,1,"The old response “Most of the times” indicates that the subject’s lips are parted most of the time when not speaking.  

The new statement says the subject’s lips are *never* parted when not speaking (i.e., usually closed). This is the opposite of “most of the times” parted, so the alignment is very low.

**Likert Score: 1**","The subject’s lips are never parted when not speaking (e.g., closed or slightly parted most ofthe time)."

**QUESTION:**
Question: Indicate which of the following are true for the subject: (i) The individual's face appears blank and emotionless, even when they are trying to express an emotion. (ii) The expression is weak or asymmetrical, and the individual has difficulty holding an expression (e.g., smile) for an extended period. Also mention if you observe other facial expression abnormalities."".",llava_qwen,"(i) The individual's face appears blank and emotionless, even when they are trying to express an emotion.",1,"The old response explicitly states that the individual's face appears ""blank and emotionless, even when they are trying to express an emotion."" This directly contradicts the new statement, which describes natural, emotionally appropriate expressions without a blank/emotionless appearance. Therefore, the alignment with the new question is very poor.

**Likert Score: 1**","The subject’s facial expressions are natural, emotionally appropriate, and symmetrical (noblank/emotionless face, weakness, asymmetry, or difficulty holding expressions)."

**QUESTION:**
Question: Document any abnormal signs observed in body parts other than the face. This includes, but is not limited to, tremors in the hands, involuntary shaking or rhythmic movements of the upper or lower extremities, stiffness or rigidity in the limbs, reduced arm swing while speaking, or any signs of bradykinesia (slowness of movement). Additionally, note any abnormal postures, difficulty in maintaining balance, or other motor irregularities that may be indicative of Parkinson's disease.",llava_qwen,No abnormal signs were observed in the body parts other than the face.,5,"The OLD_RESPONSE explicitly states: “No abnormal signs were observed in the body parts other than the face.”  

The NEW_QUESTION is a positive statement that no abnormal signs (tremors, stiffness, slowness, abnormal posture, balance issues, etc.) are observed in body parts. The response directly affirms this by reporting no abnormalities in non-facial body parts, which fully aligns with the NEW_QUESTION.

Therefore, the alignment is complete and unambiguous.

**Likert Score: 5**","No abnormal signs are observed in body parts (e.g., no tremors, involuntary shaking, stiffness,rigidity, reduced arm swing, slowness, abnormal posture, or balance issues)."

Since the video is unsupervised, there may be noise, imperfect task execution, or deviations from standard instructions. Your role is to carefully observe and describe the following aspects without making diagnostic judgments or conclusions regarding the diseases.

Task instructions: The person will talk about a recent book they have read or a movie or TV show they have watched. For this task, the face is crucial body part you should focus on. Additionally, you should also observe other body parts for relevant symptoms or signs of Parkinson's disease. However, do not give your judgement as clinician other than answering the question very carefully analyzing the video.

Please only answer the question from the video. Keep your response precise and to the point.

**QUESTION:**
Question: Provide a brief description of the subject's perceived state of mind, noting whether they appear energetic, exhausted, calm, confused, or exhibit any other relevant emotional or cognitive cues.",llava_qwen,"The subject appears to be in a calm state, with no significant changes in their facial expressions or body language throughout the video.",4,"The response explicitly states that the subject is in a calm state, which directly supports the ""appears calm"" part of the new question. It also notes no significant changes in facial expressions or body language, which is consistent with stable, appropriate energy levels (no visible agitation or hyperactivity).  

However, the response does not mention alertness, nor does it explicitly rule out exhaustion or confusion; it is simply silent on those aspects. Because of this, the alignment is good but not complete.

A reasonable rating is therefore 4 (agree).

**Likert Score: 4**","The subject appears calm and alert, with no signs of exhaustion, confusion, or inappropriate energy levels."

**QUESTION:**
Question: How far is the camera? A good position of the camera would be when the upper half of the subject's body remains visible, while the lower half is not captured in the frame. If the upper body is only partly visible, the camera is too close. If the lower body is also visible, the camera is too far.",llava_qwen,The camera is at a good position.,5,"The old response explicitly states: “The camera is at a good position.”  
Given the old question’s definition of a “good position” (upper half visible, lower half not), this directly affirms that the camera distance matches the desired framing described in the new question. There is no indication of disagreement or uncertainty.

**Likert Score: 5**","The camera distance is appropriate, with the upper half of the subject’s body visible and thelower half not captured."

Since the video is unsupervised, there may be noise, imperfect task execution, or deviations from standard instructions. Your role is to carefully observe and describe the following aspects without making diagnostic judgments or conclusions regarding the diseases.

Task instructions: The person will talk about a recent book they have read or a movie or TV show they have watched. For this task, the face is crucial body part you should focus on. Additionally, you should also observe other body parts for relevant symptoms or signs of Parkinson's disease. However, do not give your judgement as clinician other than answering the question very carefully analyzing the video.

Analyze the provided text transcription of the person’s speech and please only answer the question about from the video. Keep your response precise and to the point.

While it does not explicitly mention staying focused on the central topic or avoiding unorganized detours, there is no indication of any problems in that area, and the overall positive assessment strongly implies alignment.

**QUESTION:**
Question: Indicate if any body part critical for this task is partially visible (or invisible). For example, was the subject wearing a mask that may have obstructed important visual information? Or did the face go out of frame while the subject was completing the task?",llava_qwen,"No, the face is visible throughout the video.",5,"The old response states that “the face is visible throughout the video” and explicitly denies any obstruction (“No” to any critical part being partially visible or invisible). Since the face is a key critical body part and it remains visible for the entire task, this strongly supports the new statement that all critical body parts remain fully visible throughout. There is no indication of any obstruction or going out of frame.

**Likert Score: 5**","All critical body parts (e.g., unobstructed face) remain fully visible in the frame throughout the task."

**QUESTION:**
Question: How far is the camera? A good position of the camera would be when the upper half of the subject's body remains visible, while the lower half is not captured in the frame. If the upper body is only partly visible, the camera is too close. If the lower body is also visible, the camera is too far.",llava_qwen,The camera is at a good position.,5,"The old response explicitly states: “The camera is at a good position.”  

Given the old question’s definition of a “good position” (upper half visible, lower half not), this directly affirms that the camera distance matches the desired framing described in the new question. There is no indication of disagreement or uncertainty.

Therefore, the response fully aligns with the new positive statement.

**Likert Score: 5**","The camera distance is appropriate, with the upper half of the subject’s body visible and thelower half not captured."

Question: Indicate which of the following are true for the subject: (i) The individual's face appears blank and emotionless, even when they are trying to express an emotion. (ii) The expression is weak or asymmetrical, and the individual has difficulty holding an expression (e.g., smile) for an extended period. Also mention if you observe other facial expression abnormalities."".",llava_qwen,"(i) The individual's face appears blank and emotionless, even when they are trying to express an emotion.",1,"The old response explicitly endorses that the individual's face appears blank and emotionless, even when trying to express emotion. This directly contradicts the new statement, which describes natural, emotionally appropriate expressions without a blank/emotionless appearance. Therefore, alignment with the new question is very low.

**QUESTION:**
Question: How far is the camera? A good position of the camera would be when the upper half of the subject's body remains visible, while the lower half is not captured in the frame. If the upper body is only partly visible, the camera is too close. If the lower body is also visible, the camera is too far.",llava_qwen,The camera is at a good position.,5,"The old response directly states: “The camera is at a good position.”  

Given the old question’s definition of a “good position” (upper half visible, lower half not visible), this response implies agreement that the camera distance matches that description. There is no indication of disagreement or uncertainty.

Therefore, the response strongly aligns with the new positive statement.

**Likert Score: 5**","The camera distance is appropriate, with the upper half of the subject’s body visible and thelower half not captured."

**QUESTION:**
Question: Provide a brief description of the subject's perceived state of mind, noting whether they appear energetic, exhausted, calm, confused, or exhibit any other relevant emotional or cognitive cues.",llava_qwen,"The subject appears to be in a calm state, with no significant changes in their facial expressions or body language throughout the video.",4,"The response explicitly states that the subject appears calm, which directly supports the “appears calm” part of the new question. The mention of “no significant changes in their facial expressions or body language” suggests stability and no obvious distress, but it does not explicitly address alertness or the absence of exhaustion, confusion, or inappropriate energy levels. These aspects are not contradicted, just not mentioned.

Thus, the alignment is generally positive but incomplete, best fitting a moderately high agreement.

**QUESTION:**
Question: How far is the camera? A good position of the camera would be when the upper half of the subject's body remains visible, while the lower half is not captured in the frame. If the upper body is only partly visible, the camera is too close. If the lower body is also visible, the camera is too far.",llava_qwen,The camera is at a good position.,5,"The old response directly states: “The camera is at a good position.”  
Given the old question’s definition of a “good position” (upper half visible, lower half not visible), this implies full agreement with the new positive statement about appropriate camera distance.

Therefore, the response strongly aligns with the NEW_QUESTION.

**Likert Score: 5**","The camera distance is appropriate, with the upper half of the subject’s body visible and thelower half not captured."

**QUESTION:**
Question: Is the subject coherent in what they are speaking? Are they delivering an easy to understand story, or are they deterring a lot from the central topic and delivering an unorganized speech?",llava_qwen,"The subject is coherent in what they are speaking, delivering an easy to understand story.",5,"The response explicitly states that “The subject is coherent in what they are speaking, delivering an easy to understand story,” which directly supports the parts of the new question about coherence and ease of understanding. While it does not explicitly mention staying focused on the central topic or avoiding unorganized detours, there is no indication of any problems in that area, and “easy to understand story” reasonably implies a focused, organized narrative.

Thus, the response strongly aligns with the new question.

**Likert Score: 5**","The subject’s speech is coherent, easy to understand, and stays focused on the central topic(no unorganized detours)."

**QUESTION:**
Question: Indicate the extent of lips parting when the subject is not saying anything (i.e., always/most of the times/sometimes/very few times/never).",llava_qwen,Most of the times,1,"The old response “Most of the times” indicates that the subject’s lips are parted most of the time when not speaking.  

The new statement says the subject’s lips are *never* parted when not speaking (i.e., usually closed). This is the opposite of “most of the times” parted, so the alignment is very low.  

**Likert Score: 1**","The subject’s lips are never parted when not speaking (e.g., closed or slightly parted most ofthe time)."

This directly contradicts the NEW_QUESTION, which asserts there are no signs of confusion and that the subject appears calm and alert. While ""contemplation"" could be neutral, the explicit mention of ""mild confusion"" conflicts with the claim of no confusion. Therefore, the alignment with the NEW_QUESTION is low.

**Likert Score: 2**","The subject appears calm and alert, with no signs of exhaustion, confusion, or inappropriate energy levels."

**QUESTION:**
Question: Indicate if any body part critical for this task is partially visible (or invisible). For example, was the subject wearing a mask that may have obstructed important visual information? Or did the face go out of frame while the subject was completing the task?",llava_qwen,"No, the face was visible throughout the video.",5,"The old response states that “the face was visible throughout the video,” directly supporting the idea that a key critical body part (the face) remained fully visible for the entire task. There is no indication of any obstruction or partial visibility. This aligns strongly with the new statement that all critical body parts remain fully visible.

**Likert Score: 5**","All critical body parts (e.g., unobstructed face) remain fully visible in the frame throughout the task."

**QUESTION:**
Question: How far is the camera? A good position of the camera would be when the upper half of the subject's body remains visible, while the lower half is not captured in the frame. If the upper body is only partly visible, the camera is too close. If the lower body is also visible, the camera is too far.",llava_qwen,The camera is at a good position.,5,"The old response directly states: “The camera is at a good position.”  

Given the old question’s definition of a “good position” (upper half visible, lower half not visible), saying the camera is in a good position implies agreement that the camera distance matches that description. There is no indication of disagreement or uncertainty.

Therefore, the response strongly aligns with the new positive statement.

**Likert Score: 5**","The camera distance is appropriate, with the upper half of the subject’s body visible and thelower half not captured."

**QUESTION:**
Question: Indicate which of the following are true for the subject: (i) The individual's face appears blank and emotionless, even when they are trying to express an emotion. (ii) The expression is weak or asymmetrical, and the individual has difficulty holding an expression (e.g., smile) for an extended period. Also mention if you observe other facial expression abnormalities."".",llava_qwen,"(i) The individual's face appears blank and emotionless, even when they are trying to express an emotion.",1,"The old response explicitly states that the individual's face appears ""blank and emotionless, even when they are trying to express an emotion."" This directly contradicts the new statement, which describes natural, emotionally appropriate expressions without a blank/emotionless appearance. Therefore, the alignment with the new question is very poor.

**Likert Score: 1**","The subject’s facial expressions are natural, emotionally appropriate, and symmetrical (noblank/emotionless face, weakness, asymmetry, or difficulty holding expressions)."

Question: Provide a brief description of the subject's perceived state of mind, noting whether they appear energetic, exhausted, calm, confused, or exhibit any other relevant emotional or cognitive cues.",llava_qwen,"The subject appears to be in a calm state, with no significant changes in their facial expressions or body language throughout the video.",4,"The response explicitly states that the subject is in a calm state, which aligns with the “appears calm” part of the new question. It also notes no significant changes in facial expressions or body language, suggesting stability and no obvious signs of distress or inappropriate energy. However, the response does not explicitly address alertness or rule out exhaustion or confusion; it simply doesn’t mention them. Thus, alignment is good but not complete.

**Likert Score: 4**","The subject appears calm and alert, with no signs of exhaustion, confusion, or inappropriate energy levels."

**QUESTION:**
Question: How far is the camera? A good position of the camera would be when the upper half of the subject's body remains visible, while the lower half is not captured in the frame. If the upper body is only partly visible, the camera is too close. If the lower body is also visible, the camera is too far.",llava_qwen,The camera is at a good position.,5,"The old response directly states: “The camera is at a good position.”  
Given the old question’s definition of a “good position” (upper half visible, lower half not), this implies full agreement that the camera distance matches that description. There is no indication of disagreement or uncertainty.

Therefore, the response is fully aligned with the new positive statement.

**Likert Score: 5**","The camera distance is appropriate, with the upper half of the subject’s body visible and thelower half not captured."

**QUESTION:**
Question: Indicate the extent of lips parting when the subject is not saying anything (i.e., always/most of the times/sometimes/very few times/never).",llava_qwen,Most of the times,1,"The old response “Most of the times” indicates that the subject’s lips are parted most of the time when not speaking.  

The new statement says the subject’s lips are *never* parted when not speaking (i.e., usually closed). This is the opposite of “most of the times” parted, so the alignment is very low.

**Likert Score: 1**","The subject’s lips are never parted when not speaking (e.g., closed or slightly parted most ofthe time)."

**QUESTION:**
Question: Provide a brief description of the subject's perceived state of mind, noting whether they appear energetic, exhausted, calm, confused, or exhibit any other relevant emotional or cognitive cues.",llava_qwen,"The subject appears to be in a calm state, with no significant changes in their facial expressions or body language throughout the video.",3,"The response explicitly states that the subject is in a calm state, which directly supports the “appears calm” part of the new question. It also notes no significant changes in facial expressions or body language, which is consistent with an absence of obvious distress or inappropriate energy levels.

However, the response does not mention alertness, nor does it explicitly rule out exhaustion or confusion; it is simply silent on those aspects. Thus, while it partially supports the new statement (calm, no inappropriate energy), it does not fully confirm all components (alert, no exhaustion/confusion).

A moderately positive alignment is appropriate.

**Likert Score: 3**","The subject appears calm and alert, with no signs of exhaustion, confusion, or inappropriate energy levels."

Question: How far is the camera? A good position of the camera would be when the upper half of the subject's body remains visible, while the lower half is not captured in the frame. If the upper body is only partly visible, the camera is too close. If the lower body is also visible, the camera is too far.",llava_qwen,The camera is at a good position.,5,"The old response directly states: “The camera is at a good position.”  
Given the old question’s definition of a “good position” (upper half visible, lower half not), this implies full agreement with the new positive statement about appropriate camera distance.

Therefore, the response strongly aligns with the NEW_QUESTION.

**Likert Score: 5**","The camera distance is appropriate, with the upper half of the subject’s body visible and thelower half not captured."

**QUESTION:**
Question: How far is the camera? A good position of the camera would be when the upper half of the subject's body remains visible, while the lower half is not captured in the frame. If the upper body is only partly visible, the camera is too close. If the lower body is also visible, the camera is too far.",llava_qwen,The camera is at a good position.,5,"The old response explicitly states: “The camera is at a good position.”  

Given the old question’s definition of a “good position” (upper half visible, lower half not visible), this directly affirms that the camera distance matches the desired framing described in the new question. There is no indication of disagreement or uncertainty.  

Therefore, the response strongly agrees with the new statement.  

**Likert Score: 5**","The camera distance is appropriate, with the upper half of the subject’s body visible and thelower half not captured."

Question: Provide a brief description of the subject's perceived state of mind, noting whether they appear energetic, exhausted, calm, confused, or exhibit any other relevant emotional or cognitive cues.",llava_qwen,"The subject appears calm and composed, with no significant changes in their facial expressions or body language throughout the video.",4,"The response explicitly states that the subject appears ""calm and composed,"" which aligns well with the ""calm"" aspect of the new question. It also notes ""no significant changes in their facial expressions or body language,"" suggesting stability and no obvious signs of distress or inappropriate energy.

However, the response does not explicitly address alertness, nor does it clearly rule out exhaustion or confusion; it simply doesn’t mention them. So while there is no evidence contradicting the new statement, some elements (alertness, absence of exhaustion/confusion) are only implied, not confirmed.

Given this, the alignment is good but not complete.

**QUESTION:**
Question: How far is the camera? A good position of the camera would be when the upper half of the subject's body remains visible, while the lower half is not captured in the frame. If the upper body is only partly visible, the camera is too close. If the lower body is also visible, the camera is too far.",llava_qwen,The camera is at a good position.,5,"The old response directly states: “The camera is at a good position.”  

Given the old question’s definition of a “good position” (upper half visible, lower half not visible), this response implies agreement that the camera distance matches that description. There is no indication of disagreement or uncertainty.

Therefore, it strongly aligns with the new positive statement.

**Likert Score: 5**","The camera distance is appropriate, with the upper half of the subject’s body visible and thelower half not captured."

**QUESTION:**
Question: Is the subject coherent in what they are speaking? Are they delivering an easy to understand story, or are they deterring a lot from the central topic and delivering an unorganized speech?",llava_qwen,"The subject is coherent in what they are speaking, delivering an easy to understand story.",5,"The response explicitly states that “The subject is coherent in what they are speaking, delivering an easy to understand story,” which directly supports the parts of the new question about coherence and ease of understanding. While it does not explicitly mention staying focused on the central topic or avoiding unorganized detours, there is no indication of any problems in that area, and the positive description implies an overall organized, coherent speech.

Given this strong alignment with most of the statement and implied alignment with the rest, the most appropriate rating is 5.

**Likert Score: 5**","The subject’s speech is coherent, easy to understand, and stays focused on the central topic(no unorganized detours)."

**QUESTION:**
Question: Indicate the extent of lips parting when the subject is not saying anything (i.e., always/most of the times/sometimes/very few times/never).",llava_qwen,Most of the times,1,"The old response “Most of the times” indicates that the subject’s lips are parted most of the time when not speaking.  

The new statement says the subject’s lips are *never* parted when not speaking (i.e., usually closed). This is the opposite of “most of the times” parted, so the response strongly contradicts the new statement.

**Likert Score: 1**","The subject’s lips are never parted when not speaking (e.g., closed or slightly parted most ofthe time)."

Or did the face go out of frame while the subject was completing the task?",llava_qwen,"No, the face was visible throughout the task.",5,"The response states that “the face was visible throughout the task” and indicates no obstruction or disappearance from the frame.

**QUESTION:**
Question: How far is the camera? A good position of the camera would be when the upper half of the subject's body remains visible, while the lower half is not captured in the frame. If the upper body is only partly visible, the camera is too close. If the lower body is also visible, the camera is too far.",llava_qwen,The camera is at a good position.,5,"The old response explicitly states: “The camera is at a good position.”  
Given the old question’s definition of a “good position” (upper half visible, lower half not), this directly affirms that the camera distance matches the desired framing described in the new question.

Therefore, the response fully aligns with the new positive statement.

**Likert Score: 5**","The camera distance is appropriate, with the upper half of the subject’s body visible and thelower half not captured."

Question: Indicate the extent of lips parting when the subject is not saying anything (i.e., always/most of the times/sometimes/very few times/never).",llava_qwen,Most of the times,1,"The old response says “Most of the times” the lips are parted when not speaking.  

The new statement claims the lips are *never* parted and are closed or only slightly parted most of the time. This directly contradicts the old response, which indicates frequent parting rather than never.  

Therefore, alignment with the new statement is very low.  
**Likert Score: 1**","The subject’s lips are never parted when not speaking (e.g., closed or slightly parted most ofthe time)."

**QUESTION:**
Question: How far is the camera? A good position of the camera would be when the upper half of the subject's body remains visible, while the lower half is not captured in the frame. If the upper body is only partly visible, the camera is too close. If the lower body is also visible, the camera is too far.",llava_qwen,The camera is at a good position.,5,"The old response directly states: “The camera is at a good position.”  
Given the old question’s definition of a “good position” (upper half visible, lower half not), this implies full agreement that the camera distance matches that description. There is no indication of disagreement or uncertainty.

Therefore, the response is fully aligned with the new positive statement.

**Likert Score: 5**","The camera distance is appropriate, with the upper half of the subject’s body visible and thelower half not captured."

**QUESTION:**
Question: Indicate if any body part critical for this task is partially visible (or invisible). For example, was the subject wearing a mask that may have obstructed important visual information? Or did the face go out of frame while the subject was completing the task?",llava_qwen,"No, the face was visible throughout the task.",5,"The response explicitly states that “the face was visible throughout the task,” directly supporting the idea that a critical body part (the face) remained fully visible for the entire duration. There is no indication of any obstruction or partial visibility, so this strongly aligns with the new positive statement.

**Likert Score: 5**","All critical body parts (e.g., unobstructed face) remain fully visible in the frame throughout the task."
