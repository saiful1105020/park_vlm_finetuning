**QUESTION:**
Question: How far is the camera? A good position of the camera would be when the upper half of the subject's body remains visible, while the lower half is not captured in the frame. If the upper body is only partly visible, the camera is too close. If the lower body is also visible, the camera is too far.",llava_qwen,The camera is at a good position.,5,"The old response explicitly states: “The camera is at a good position.”  
Given the old question’s definition of a “good position” (upper half visible, lower half not), this directly affirms that the camera distance matches the desired framing described in the new question.

Therefore, the response strongly agrees with the new statement.

**Likert Score: 5**","The camera distance is appropriate, with the upper half of the subject’s body visible and thelower half not captured."

**QUESTION:**
Question: Indicate which of the following are true for the subject: (i) The individual's face appears blank and emotionless, even when they are trying to express an emotion. (ii) The expression is weak or asymmetrical, and the individual has difficulty holding an expression (e.g., smile) for an extended period. Also mention if you observe other facial expression abnormalities."".",llava_qwen,"(i) The individual's face appears blank and emotionless, even when they are trying to express an emotion.",1,"The old response explicitly endorses that the individual's face appears blank and emotionless, even when trying to express emotion. This directly contradicts the new statement, which describes natural, emotionally appropriate expressions without a blank/emotionless appearance. Therefore, the alignment with the new question is very low.

Since the video is unsupervised, there may be noise, imperfect task execution, or deviations from standard instructions. Your role is to carefully observe and describe the following aspects without making diagnostic judgments or conclusions regarding the diseases.

Task instructions: The person will talk about a recent book they have read or a movie or TV show they have watched. For this task, the face is crucial body part you should focus on. Additionally, you should also observe other body parts for relevant symptoms or signs of Parkinson's disease.

**QUESTION:**
Question: Provide a brief description of the subject's perceived state of mind, noting whether they appear energetic, exhausted, calm, confused, or exhibit any other relevant emotional or cognitive cues.",llava_qwen,"The subject appears calm and composed, with no significant changes in their facial expressions or body language throughout the video.",4,"The old response states the subject is ""calm and composed"" with stable facial expressions and body language. This directly supports the ""calm"" aspect of the new question and suggests no signs of confusion or inappropriate energy (since behavior is steady and composed). However, it does not explicitly mention alertness or the absence of exhaustion, so those parts are only weakly implied, not confirmed.

Overall, the response mostly aligns with the new question but lacks explicit evidence for ""alert"" and ""no signs of exhaustion.""

**Likert Score: 4**","The subject appears calm and alert, with no signs of exhaustion, confusion, or inappropriate energy levels."

**QUESTION:**
Question: Indicate if any body part critical for this task is partially visible (or invisible). For example, was the subject wearing a mask that may have obstructed important visual information? Or did the face go out of frame while the subject was completing the task?",llava_qwen,"No, the face is visible throughout the video.",5,"The old response states that “the face is visible throughout the video” and explicitly denies any obstruction (“No”). Since the example of a critical body part in the new question is an unobstructed face, this directly supports the statement that all critical body parts remain fully visible throughout the task. There is no indication of any partial visibility or obstruction.

**Likert Score: 5**","All critical body parts (e.g., unobstructed face) remain fully visible in the frame throughout the task."

It also notes ""no significant changes in their facial expressions or body language,"" suggesting stability and no obvious signs of exhaustion, confusion, or inappropriate energy.

However, the response does not explicitly address ""alertness,"" and we cannot be certain from the description that the subject is alert rather than, for example, calm but drowsy. Still, nothing in the description contradicts alertness or suggests exhaustion or confusion.

Overall, the alignment is good but not complete due to the missing explicit indication of alertness.

**Likert Score: 4**","The subject appears calm and alert, with no signs of exhaustion, confusion, or inappropriate energy levels."

Question: Indicate if any body part critical for this task is partially visible (or invisible). For example, was the subject wearing a mask that may have obstructed important visual information? Or did the face go out of frame while the subject was completing the task?",llava_qwen,"No, the face is visible throughout the video.",5,"The old response explicitly states that “the face is visible throughout the video,” directly supporting the idea that a critical body part (the face) remains fully visible for the entire task.

**QUESTION:**
Question: Indicate which of the following are true for the subject: (i) The individual's face appears blank and emotionless, even when they are trying to express an emotion. (ii) The expression is weak or asymmetrical, and the individual has difficulty holding an expression (e.g., smile) for an extended period. Also mention if you observe other facial expression abnormalities."".",llava_qwen,"(i) The individual's face appears blank and emotionless, even when they are trying to express an emotion.",1,"The old response explicitly endorses that the individual's face appears blank and emotionless, even when trying to express emotion. This directly contradicts the new statement, which describes natural, emotionally appropriate expressions without a blank/emotionless appearance. Therefore, the alignment with the new question is very low.

**Likert Score: 1**","The subject’s facial expressions are natural, emotionally appropriate, and symmetrical (noblank/emotionless face, weakness, asymmetry, or difficulty holding expressions)."

**QUESTION:**
Question: Indicate if any body part critical for this task is partially visible (or invisible). For example, was the subject wearing a mask that may have obstructed important visual information? Or did the face go out of frame while the subject was completing the task?",llava_qwen,"No, the face was visible throughout the video.",5,"The old response states that “the face was visible throughout the video,” directly supporting the idea that a key critical body part (the face) remained fully visible for the entire task. There is no indication of any obstruction or partial visibility. This strongly aligns with the new statement that all critical body parts remain fully visible.

**Likert Score: 5**","All critical body parts (e.g., unobstructed face) remain fully visible in the frame throughout the task."

**QUESTION:**
Question: Is the subject coherent in what they are speaking? Are they delivering an easy to understand story, or are they deterring a lot from the central topic and delivering an unorganized speech?",llava_qwen,"The subject is coherent in what they are speaking, delivering an easy to understand story.",5,"The response explicitly states that “The subject is coherent in what they are speaking, delivering an easy to understand story,” which directly supports the parts of the new question about coherence and ease of understanding. While it does not explicitly mention staying focused on the central topic or avoiding unorganized detours, there is no indication of any problems in that area, and “easy to understand story” reasonably implies a focused, organized narrative.

Thus, the response strongly aligns with the new question.

**Likert Score: 5**","The subject’s speech is coherent, easy to understand, and stays focused on the central topic(no unorganized detours)."

**QUESTION:**
Question: Indicate which of the following are true for the subject: (i) The individual's face appears blank and emotionless, even when they are trying to express an emotion. (ii) The expression is weak or asymmetrical, and the individual has difficulty holding an expression (e.g., smile) for an extended period. Also mention if you observe other facial expression abnormalities."".",llava_qwen,"(i) The individual's face appears blank and emotionless, even when they are trying to express an emotion.",1,"The old response explicitly endorses that the individual's face appears blank and emotionless, even when trying to express emotion. This directly contradicts the new statement, which describes natural, emotionally appropriate expressions without a blank/emotionless appearance. Therefore, the alignment with the new question is very low.

**Likert Score: 1**","The subject’s facial expressions are natural, emotionally appropriate, and symmetrical (noblank/emotionless face, weakness, asymmetry, or difficulty holding expressions)."

**QUESTION:**
Question: Indicate if any body part critical for this task is partially visible (or invisible). For example, was the subject wearing a mask that may have obstructed important visual information? Or did the face go out of frame while the subject was completing the task?",llava_qwen,"No, the face is visible throughout the video.",5,"The old response explicitly states that “the face is visible throughout the video,” directly supporting the idea that a critical body part (the face) remains fully visible for the entire task. There is no mention of any obstruction or partial visibility, so this aligns strongly with the new statement about all critical body parts (e.g., unobstructed face) remaining fully visible.

**QUESTION:**
Question: How far is the camera? A good position of the camera would be when the upper half of the subject's body remains visible, while the lower half is not captured in the frame. If the upper body is only partly visible, the camera is too close. If the lower body is also visible, the camera is too far.",llava_qwen,The camera is at a good position.,5,"The old response directly states: “The camera is at a good position.”  

Given the old question’s definition of a “good position” (upper half visible, lower half not visible), saying the camera is at a good position implies agreement that the camera distance matches that description. There is no indication of disagreement or uncertainty.

Therefore, the response strongly aligns with the new positive statement.

**Likert Score: 5**","The camera distance is appropriate, with the upper half of the subject’s body visible and thelower half not captured."

**QUESTION:**
Question: Is the subject coherent in what they are speaking? Are they delivering an easy to understand story, or are they deterring a lot from the central topic and delivering an unorganized speech?",llava_qwen,"The subject is coherent in what they are speaking, delivering an easy to understand story.",5,"The response explicitly states that “The subject is coherent in what they are speaking, delivering an easy to understand story,” which directly supports the ideas of coherence and ease of understanding in the new question.

**QUESTION:**
Question: Indicate the extent of lips parting when the subject is not saying anything (i.e., always/most of the times/sometimes/very few times/never).",llava_qwen,Most of the times,1,"The old response “Most of the times” indicates that the subject’s lips are parted most of the time when not speaking.  

The new statement says the subject’s lips are *never* parted when not speaking (i.e., usually closed). This is the opposite of “most of the times parted,” so the alignment is very low.

**Likert Score: 1**","The subject’s lips are never parted when not speaking (e.g., closed or slightly parted most ofthe time)."

This directly supports calmness and stability and suggests no signs of confusion or emotional disturbance. However, it does not explicitly mention alertness or absence of exhaustion or inappropriate energy levels, though these can be reasonably inferred from ""composed"" and stable state.

**QUESTION:**
Question: How far is the camera? A good position of the camera would be when the upper half of the subject's body remains visible, while the lower half is not captured in the frame. If the upper body is only partly visible, the camera is too close. If the lower body is also visible, the camera is too far.",llava_qwen,The camera is at a good position.,5,"The old response directly states: “The camera is at a good position.”  
Given the old question’s definition of a “good position” (upper half visible, lower half not), this implies full agreement with the new positive statement about appropriate camera distance.

Therefore, the response strongly aligns with the NEW_QUESTION.

**Likert Score: 5**","The camera distance is appropriate, with the upper half of the subject’s body visible and thelower half not captured."

**QUESTION:**
Question: Indicate which of the following are true for the subject: (i) The individual's face appears blank and emotionless, even when they are trying to express an emotion. (ii) The expression is weak or asymmetrical, and the individual has difficulty holding an expression (e.g., smile) for an extended period. Also mention if you observe other facial expression abnormalities."".",llava_qwen,"(i) The individual's face appears blank and emotionless, even when they are trying to express an emotion.",1,"The old response explicitly states that the individual's face appears ""blank and emotionless, even when they are trying to express an emotion."" This directly contradicts the new statement, which describes natural, emotionally appropriate expressions without a blank/emotionless appearance. Therefore, the alignment with the new question is very poor.

**Likert Score: 1**","The subject’s facial expressions are natural, emotionally appropriate, and symmetrical (noblank/emotionless face, weakness, asymmetry, or difficulty holding expressions)."

**QUESTION:**
Question: Indicate if any body part critical for this task is partially visible (or invisible). For example, was the subject wearing a mask that may have obstructed important visual information? Or did the face go out of frame while the subject was completing the task?",llava_qwen,"No, the face was visible throughout the task.",5,"The old response explicitly states that “the face was visible throughout the task” and that there was no obstruction. Since the face is a critical body part and it remained visible for the entire task, this directly supports the new statement that all critical body parts (e.g., unobstructed face) remain fully visible in the frame throughout. There is no indication of any partial visibility or obstruction.

**QUESTION:**
Question: How far is the camera? A good position of the camera would be when the upper half of the subject's body remains visible, while the lower half is not captured in the frame. If the upper body is only partly visible, the camera is too close. If the lower body is also visible, the camera is too far.",llava_qwen,The camera is at a good position.,5,"The old response explicitly states: “The camera is at a good position.”  
Given the old question’s definition of a “good position” (upper half visible, lower half not), this directly affirms that the camera distance matches the desired framing described in the new question.

Therefore, the response strongly agrees with the new statement.

**Likert Score: 5**","The camera distance is appropriate, with the upper half of the subject’s body visible and thelower half not captured."

**QUESTION:**
Question: Is the subject coherent in what they are speaking? Are they delivering an easy to understand story, or are they deterring a lot from the central topic and delivering an unorganized speech?",llava_qwen,"The subject is coherent in what they are speaking, delivering an easy to understand story.",5,"The response explicitly states that “The subject is coherent in what they are speaking, delivering an easy to understand story,” which directly supports the parts of the new question about coherence and ease of understanding. While it does not explicitly mention staying on the central topic or avoiding unorganized detours, there is no indication of any problems in that area, and the overall tone is clearly positive and aligned with the full statement.

Given this strong alignment with all key elements (coherent, easy to understand, and implicitly organized), the most appropriate rating is 5.

**Likert Score: 5**","The subject’s speech is coherent, easy to understand, and stays focused on the central topic(no unorganized detours)."

**QUESTION:**
Question: How far is the camera? A good position of the camera would be when the upper half of the subject's body remains visible, while the lower half is not captured in the frame. If the upper body is only partly visible, the camera is too close. If the lower body is also visible, the camera is too far.",llava_qwen,The camera is at a good position.,5,"The old response explicitly states: “The camera is at a good position.”  
Given the old question’s definition of a “good position” (upper half visible, lower half not), this directly affirms that the camera distance matches the desired framing described in the new question.

Therefore, the response strongly agrees with the new statement.

**Likert Score: 5**","The camera distance is appropriate, with the upper half of the subject’s body visible and thelower half not captured."

Are they delivering an easy to understand story, or are they deterring a lot from the central topic and delivering an unorganized speech?",llava_qwen,"The subject is coherent in what they are speaking, delivering an easy to understand story.",5,"The response explicitly states that “The subject is coherent in what they are speaking, delivering an easy to understand story,” which directly supports the parts of the new question about coherence and ease of understanding. While it does not explicitly mention staying focused on the central topic or avoiding unorganized detours, there is no indication of any problems in that area, and “easy to understand story” reasonably implies a focused, organized narrative.

Thus, the response strongly aligns with the new question.

**QUESTION:**
Question: Indicate which of the following are true for the subject: (i) The individual's face appears blank and emotionless, even when they are trying to express an emotion. (ii) The expression is weak or asymmetrical, and the individual has difficulty holding an expression (e.g., smile) for an extended period. Also mention if you observe other facial expression abnormalities."".",llava_qwen,"(i) The individual's face appears blank and emotionless, even when they are trying to express an emotion.",1,"The OLD_RESPONSE explicitly endorses that the individual's face appears blank and emotionless, even when trying to express emotion.

**QUESTION:**
Question: Indicate if any body part critical for this task is partially visible (or invisible). For example, was the subject wearing a mask that may have obstructed important visual information? Or did the face go out of frame while the subject was completing the task?",llava_qwen,"No, the face is visible throughout the video.",5,"The old response states that “the face is visible throughout the video” and explicitly denies any obstruction (“No”). Since the example of a critical body part in the new question is an unobstructed face, this directly supports the statement that all critical body parts remain fully visible throughout the task. There is no indication of any partial visibility or obstruction.

**Likert Score: 5**","All critical body parts (e.g., unobstructed face) remain fully visible in the frame throughout the task."

**QUESTION:**
Question: How far is the camera? A good position of the camera would be when the upper half of the subject's body remains visible, while the lower half is not captured in the frame. If the upper body is only partly visible, the camera is too close. If the lower body is also visible, the camera is too far.",llava_qwen,The camera is at a good position.,5,"The old response directly states: “The camera is at a good position.”  
Given the old question’s definition of a “good position” (upper half visible, lower half not), this implies full agreement with the new positive statement about appropriate camera distance.

Therefore, the response strongly aligns with the NEW_QUESTION.

**Likert Score: 5**","The camera distance is appropriate, with the upper half of the subject’s body visible and thelower half not captured."

**QUESTION:**
Question: Indicate if any body part critical for this task is partially visible (or invisible). For example, was the subject wearing a mask that may have obstructed important visual information? Or did the face go out of frame while the subject was completing the task?",llava_qwen,"No, the face is visible throughout the video.",5,"The old response states that “the face is visible throughout the video” and explicitly says “No” to any critical body part being partially visible or invisible. This directly supports the new statement that critical body parts (like an unobstructed face) remain fully visible throughout the task. There is no indication of any obstruction or going out of frame.

**Likert Score: 5**","All critical body parts (e.g., unobstructed face) remain fully visible in the frame throughout the task."

**QUESTION:**
Question: How far is the camera? A good position of the camera would be when the upper half of the subject's body remains visible, while the lower half is not captured in the frame. If the upper body is only partly visible, the camera is too close. If the lower body is also visible, the camera is too far.",llava_qwen,The camera is at a good position.,5,"The old response explicitly states: “The camera is at a good position,” directly addressing the old question’s definition of a good position (upper half visible, lower half not). This strongly implies agreement that the camera distance matches the described ideal in the new question.

Therefore, the alignment with the new positive statement is very high.

**Likert Score: 5**","The camera distance is appropriate, with the upper half of the subject’s body visible and thelower half not captured."

**QUESTION:**
Question: Is the subject coherent in what they are speaking? Are they delivering an easy to understand story, or are they deterring a lot from the central topic and delivering an unorganized speech?",llava_qwen,"The subject is coherent in what they are speaking, delivering an easy to understand story.",5,"The response explicitly states that “The subject is coherent in what they are speaking, delivering an easy to understand story.” This directly supports the parts of the new question about coherence and ease of understanding. While it does not explicitly mention staying focused on the central topic or avoiding unorganized detours, there is no indication of any problems in that area, and the overall tone is clearly positive.

Given the strong alignment with coherence and clarity, and the implied absence of disorganization, the best rating is 5 (strongly agree).

**Likert Score: 5**","The subject’s speech is coherent, easy to understand, and stays focused on the central topic(no unorganized detours)."

**QUESTION:**
Question: Indicate the extent of lips parting when the subject is not saying anything (i.e., always/most of the times/sometimes/very few times/never).",llava_qwen,Most of the times,1,"The old response “Most of the times” indicates that the subject’s lips are parted most of the time when not speaking.  

The new statement says the subject’s lips are *never* parted when not speaking (i.e., generally closed). This is the opposite of “most of the times” parted, so the alignment is very low.

**Likert Score: 1**","The subject’s lips are never parted when not speaking (e.g., closed or slightly parted most ofthe time)."

**QUESTION:**
Question: Indicate which of the following are true for the subject: (i) The individual's face appears blank and emotionless, even when they are trying to express an emotion. (ii) The expression is weak or asymmetrical, and the individual has difficulty holding an expression (e.g., smile) for an extended period. Also mention if you observe other facial expression abnormalities."".",llava_qwen,"(i) The individual's face appears blank and emotionless, even when they are trying to express an emotion.",1,"The old response explicitly endorses that the individual's face appears blank and emotionless, even when trying to express emotion. This directly contradicts the new statement, which describes natural, emotionally appropriate expressions without a blank/emotionless appearance. Therefore, alignment with the new question is very low.

**Likert Score: 1**","The subject’s facial expressions are natural, emotionally appropriate, and symmetrical (noblank/emotionless face, weakness, asymmetry, or difficulty holding expressions)."

Additionally, you should also observe other body parts for relevant symptoms or signs of Parkinson's disease. However, do not give your judgement as clinician other than answering the question very carefully analyzing the video.

Since the video is unsupervised, there may be noise, imperfect task execution, or deviations from standard instructions. Your role is to carefully observe and describe the following aspects without making diagnostic judgments or conclusions regarding the diseases.

Task instructions: The person will talk about a recent book they have read or a movie or TV show they have watched. For this task, the face is crucial body part you should focus on. Additionally, you should also observe other body parts for relevant symptoms or signs of Parkinson's disease. However, do not give your judgement as clinician other than answering the question very carefully analyzing the video.

Please only answer the question from the video. Keep your response precise and to the point.

**QUESTION:**
Question: Provide a brief description of the subject's perceived state of mind, noting whether they appear energetic, exhausted, calm, confused, or exhibit any other relevant emotional or cognitive cues.",llava_qwen,"The subject appears to be in a state of calm, with no significant changes in their facial expressions or body language throughout the video.",4,"The response explicitly states that the subject appears calm, which directly supports the “appears calm” part of the new question. It also notes “no significant changes in their facial expressions or body language,” which is consistent with an absence of obvious distress or agitation, and does not suggest exhaustion, confusion, or inappropriate energy.

However, the response does not explicitly mention alertness or specifically rule out exhaustion or confusion; it is inferred rather than stated. Because of this, the alignment is strong but not complete.

**Likert Score: 4**","The subject appears calm and alert, with no signs of exhaustion, confusion, or inappropriate energy levels."

**QUESTION:**
Question: Indicate if any body part critical for this task is partially visible (or invisible). For example, was the subject wearing a mask that may have obstructed important visual information? Or did the face go out of frame while the subject was completing the task?",llava_qwen,"No, the face is visible throughout the video.",5,"The old response states that “the face is visible throughout the video” and explicitly denies any obstruction (“No”). Since the face is a critical body part and is reported as continuously visible, this strongly supports the new statement that all critical body parts (e.g., unobstructed face) remain fully visible throughout the task. There is no indication of any partial visibility or obstruction.

**Likert Score: 5**","All critical body parts (e.g., unobstructed face) remain fully visible in the frame throughout the task."

Since the video is unsupervised, there may be noise, imperfect task execution, or deviations from standard instructions. Your role is to carefully observe and describe the following aspects without making diagnostic judgments or conclusions regarding the diseases.

Task instructions: The person will talk about a recent book they have read or a movie or TV show they have watched. For this task, the face is crucial body part you should focus on. Additionally, you should also observe other body parts for relevant symptoms or signs of Parkinson's disease. However, do not give your judgement as clinician other than answering the question very carefully analyzing the video.

**QUESTION:**
Question: How far is the camera? A good position of the camera would be when the upper half of the subject's body remains visible, while the lower half is not captured in the frame. If the upper body is only partly visible, the camera is too close. If the lower body is also visible, the camera is too far.",llava_qwen,The camera is at a good position.,5,"The old response directly states: “The camera is at a good position.”  
Given the old question’s definition of a “good position” (upper half visible, lower half not), this implies full agreement with the new positive statement about appropriate camera distance.

Therefore, the response strongly aligns with the NEW_QUESTION.

**Likert Score: 5**","The camera distance is appropriate, with the upper half of the subject’s body visible and thelower half not captured."

**QUESTION:**
Question: Is the subject coherent in what they are speaking? Are they delivering an easy to understand story, or are they deterring a lot from the central topic and delivering an unorganized speech?",llava_qwen,"The subject is coherent in what they are speaking, delivering an easy to understand story.",5,"The response explicitly states that “The subject is coherent in what they are speaking, delivering an easy to understand story,” which directly supports the parts of the new question about coherence and ease of understanding. While it does not explicitly mention staying focused on the central topic or avoiding unorganized detours, there is no indication of any problems in that area, and “easy to understand story” reasonably implies a focused, organized narrative.

Thus, the response strongly aligns with the new statement.

Question: Indicate which of the following are true for the subject: (i) The individual's face appears blank and emotionless, even when they are trying to express an emotion. (ii) The expression is weak or asymmetrical, and the individual has difficulty holding an expression (e.g., smile) for an extended period. Also mention if you observe other facial expression abnormalities."".",llava_qwen,"(i) The individual's face appears blank and emotionless, even when they are trying to express an emotion.",1,"The old response explicitly endorses that the individual's face appears blank and emotionless, even when trying to express emotion. This directly contradicts the new statement, which describes natural, emotionally appropriate expressions without a blank/emotionless appearance. Therefore, the alignment with the new question is very low.

However, it does not mention alertness, nor does it address exhaustion, confusion, or energy level explicitly.

Because the response partially aligns (supports calmness and suggests appropriate demeanor via ""composed"") but does not explicitly cover all aspects of the new statement, a moderately high score is appropriate.

**QUESTION:**
Question: Indicate if any body part critical for this task is partially visible (or invisible). For example, was the subject wearing a mask that may have obstructed important visual information? Or did the face go out of frame while the subject was completing the task?",llava_qwen,"No, the face is visible throughout the video.",5,"The old response states that “the face is visible throughout the video” and explicitly denies any obstruction (“No”). Since the face is a critical body part and is reported as continuously visible, this strongly supports the new statement that all critical body parts (e.g., unobstructed face) remain fully visible throughout the task. There is no indication of any partial visibility or obstruction.

**Likert Score: 5**","All critical body parts (e.g., unobstructed face) remain fully visible in the frame throughout the task."

If the lower body is also visible, the camera is too far.",llava_qwen,The camera is at a good position.,5,"The old response directly states: “The camera is at a good position.”  
Given the old question’s definition of a “good position” (upper half visible, lower half not), this implies full agreement with the new positive statement about appropriate camera distance.

Therefore, the response strongly aligns with the NEW_QUESTION.

**Likert Score: 5**","The camera distance is appropriate, with the upper half of the subject’s body visible and thelower half not captured."

**QUESTION:**
Question: Is the subject coherent in what they are speaking? Are they delivering an easy to understand story, or are they deterring a lot from the central topic and delivering an unorganized speech?",llava_qwen,"The subject is coherent in what they are speaking, delivering an easy to understand story.",5,"The response explicitly states that “The subject is coherent in what they are speaking, delivering an easy to understand story,” which directly supports the parts of the new question about coherence and ease of understanding. While it does not explicitly mention staying focused on the central topic or avoiding unorganized detours, there is no indication of any problems in that area, and the positive description implies an organized, focused speech.

Given this strong alignment with all key aspects (coherent, easy to understand, and implicitly organized), the most appropriate rating is 5.

**Likert Score: 5**","The subject’s speech is coherent, easy to understand, and stays focused on the central topic(no unorganized detours)."

**QUESTION:**
Question: Indicate if any body part critical for this task is partially visible (or invisible). For example, was the subject wearing a mask that may have obstructed important visual information? Or did the face go out of frame while the subject was completing the task?",llava_qwen,"No, the face is visible throughout the video.",5,"The old response states that “the face is visible throughout the video” and explicitly denies any obstruction (“No”). Since the face is a critical body part and is reported as continuously visible, this strongly supports the new statement that all critical body parts (e.g., unobstructed face) remain fully visible throughout the task. There is no indication of any partial invisibility or obstruction.

**Likert Score: 5**","All critical body parts (e.g., unobstructed face) remain fully visible in the frame throughout the task."

**QUESTION:**
Question: How far is the camera? A good position of the camera would be when the upper half of the subject's body remains visible, while the lower half is not captured in the frame. If the upper body is only partly visible, the camera is too close. If the lower body is also visible, the camera is too far.",llava_qwen,The camera is at a good position.,5,"The old response directly states: “The camera is at a good position.”  

Given the old question’s definition of a “good position” (upper half visible, lower half not visible), this response implies agreement that the camera distance matches that description. There is no indication of disagreement or uncertainty.

Therefore, it strongly aligns with the new positive statement.

**Likert Score: 5**","The camera distance is appropriate, with the upper half of the subject’s body visible and thelower half not captured."

The new statement says the subject’s lips are *never* parted when not speaking (i.e., usually closed). This is the opposite of “most of the times parted,” so the alignment is very low.

Question: Document any abnormal signs observed in body parts other than the face. This includes, but is not limited to, tremors in the hands, involuntary shaking or rhythmic movements of the upper or lower extremities, stiffness or rigidity in the limbs, reduced arm swing while speaking, or any signs of bradykinesia (slowness of movement). Additionally, note any abnormal postures, difficulty in maintaining balance, or other motor irregularities that may be indicative of Parkinson's disease.",llava_qwen,No abnormal signs were observed in the body parts other than the face.,5,"The OLD_RESPONSE explicitly states: “No abnormal signs were observed in the body parts other than the face.”  

The NEW_QUESTION is a positive statement that no abnormal signs (tremors, rigidity, slowness, abnormal posture, balance issues, etc.) are observed in body parts. The response directly affirms this by reporting no abnormalities outside the face, which fully aligns with the NEW_QUESTION.

**Likert Score: 5**","No abnormal signs are observed in body parts (e.g., no tremors, involuntary shaking, stiffness,rigidity, reduced arm swing, slowness, abnormal posture, or balance issues)."

Question: How far is the camera? A good position of the camera would be when the upper half of the subject's body remains visible, while the lower half is not captured in the frame.

If the lower body is also visible, the camera is too far.",llava_qwen,The camera is at a good position.,5,"The old response directly states: “The camera is at a good position.”

Therefore, the response strongly aligns with the NEW_QUESTION.

**QUESTION:**
Question: Provide a brief description of the subject's perceived state of mind, noting whether they appear energetic, exhausted, calm, confused, or exhibit any other relevant emotional or cognitive cues.",llava_qwen,"The subject appears to be in a calm state, with no significant changes in their facial expressions or body language throughout the video.",4,"The response explicitly states that the subject appears calm, which directly supports the “appears calm” part of the new question. The mention of “no significant changes in their facial expressions or body language” suggests stability and no obvious distress, but it does not explicitly address alertness or the absence of exhaustion, confusion, or inappropriate energy levels. These aspects are therefore only weakly implied, not clearly confirmed.

Given this, the alignment is good for calmness but incomplete for the rest of the statement.

**Likert Score: 4**","The subject appears calm and alert, with no signs of exhaustion, confusion, or inappropriate energy levels."

**QUESTION:**
Question: Please describe whether the person demonstrates any difficulty through their facial expressions. Some examples of visible difficulty include furrowed brow, squinting eyes, clenched jaw, tight lips, head hanging low, sighing, wrinkled forehead, etc. Mention such specific details when found."".",llava_qwen,"The person demonstrates a furrowed brow and a slightly clenched jaw, which could indicate concentration or mild difficulty.",1,"The response explicitly notes a “furrowed brow” and “slightly clenched jaw,” both given as examples of visible difficulty in the original question. Even though it allows that this “could indicate concentration or mild difficulty,” it clearly describes signs that contradict the statement “shows no signs of difficulty.” Therefore, the alignment with the new question is very low.

**Likert Score: 1**",The person shows no signs of difficulty in facial expressions.

**QUESTION:**
Question: How far is the camera? A good position of the camera would be when the upper half of the subject's body remains visible, while the lower half is not captured in the frame. If the upper body is only partly visible, the camera is too close. If the lower body is also visible, the camera is too far.",llava_qwen,The camera is at a good position.,5,"The old response explicitly states: “The camera is at a good position.”  
Given the old question’s definition of a “good position” (upper half visible, lower half not), this directly affirms that the camera distance matches the described ideal.  
Thus, it strongly agrees with the new positive statement.

**Likert Score: 5**","The camera distance is appropriate, with the upper half of the subject’s body visible and thelower half not captured."

Since the video is unsupervised, there may be noise, imperfect task execution, or deviations from standard instructions. Your role is to carefully observe and describe the following aspects without making diagnostic judgments or conclusions regarding the diseases.

Task instructions: The person will talk about a recent book they have read or a movie or TV show they have watched. For this task, the face is crucial body part you should focus on. Additionally, you should also observe other body parts for relevant symptoms or signs of Parkinson's disease.

Question: Is the subject coherent in what they are speaking? Are they delivering an easy to understand story, or are they deterring a lot from the central topic and delivering an unorganized speech?",llava_qwen,"The subject is coherent in what they are speaking, delivering an easy to understand story.",5,"The response explicitly states that “The subject is coherent in what they are speaking, delivering an easy to understand story,” which directly supports the parts of the new question about coherence and ease of understanding. While it does not explicitly mention staying focused on the central topic or avoiding unorganized detours, there is no indication of any problems in that area, and describing the story as “easy to understand” implies a generally organized, focused narrative.

**QUESTION:**
Question: Provide a brief description of the subject's perceived state of mind, noting whether they appear energetic, exhausted, calm, confused, or exhibit any other relevant emotional or cognitive cues.",llava_qwen,"The subject appears to be in a calm state, with no significant changes in their emotional or cognitive state throughout the video.",4,"The old response explicitly states that the subject is in a calm state and that there are no significant changes in their emotional or cognitive state. This aligns well with the “appears calm” and “no signs of exhaustion, confusion, or inappropriate energy levels” aspects of the new question, since stability and lack of notable changes suggest no obvious negative signs. However, the response does not explicitly mention “alert,” so that part is only implied, not confirmed.

Given this, the alignment is strong but not complete.

**Likert Score: 4**","The subject appears calm and alert, with no signs of exhaustion, confusion, or inappropriate energy levels."

**QUESTION:**
Question: How far is the camera? A good position of the camera would be when the upper half of the subject's body remains visible, while the lower half is not captured in the frame. If the upper body is only partly visible, the camera is too close. If the lower body is also visible, the camera is too far.",llava_qwen,The camera is at a good position.,5,"The old response directly states: “The camera is at a good position.”  

Given the old question’s definition of a “good position” (upper half visible, lower half not visible), this response implies agreement that the camera distance matches that description. There is no indication of disagreement or uncertainty.

Therefore, it strongly aligns with the new positive statement.

**Likert Score: 5**","The camera distance is appropriate, with the upper half of the subject’s body visible and thelower half not captured."

**QUESTION:**
Question: Provide a brief description of the subject's perceived state of mind, noting whether they appear energetic, exhausted, calm, confused, or exhibit any other relevant emotional or cognitive cues.",llava_qwen,"The subject appears calm and composed, with no significant changes in their facial expressions or body language throughout the video.",4,"The response explicitly states that the subject appears ""calm and composed,"" which directly supports the ""calm"" aspect of the new question. The mention of ""no significant changes in their facial expressions or body language"" suggests stability and no obvious signs of distress, confusion, or inappropriate energy.

However, the response does not explicitly address alertness or the absence of exhaustion or confusion. These can be somewhat inferred from ""composed"" and stable behavior, but they are not clearly stated.

Overall, the alignment is good but not complete, so a 4 is most appropriate.

**QUESTION:**
Question: Indicate if any body part critical for this task is partially visible (or invisible). For example, was the subject wearing a mask that may have obstructed important visual information? Or did the face go out of frame while the subject was completing the task?",llava_qwen,"No, the face is visible throughout the video.",5,"The old response states that “the face is visible throughout the video” and explicitly denies any obstruction (“No”). Since the face is a critical body part and is reported as continuously visible, this strongly supports the new statement that all critical body parts (e.g., unobstructed face) remain fully visible throughout the task. There is no indication of any partial visibility or obstruction.

**Likert Score: 5**","All critical body parts (e.g., unobstructed face) remain fully visible in the frame throughout the task."

**QUESTION:**
Question: How far is the camera? A good position of the camera would be when the upper half of the subject's body remains visible, while the lower half is not captured in the frame. If the upper body is only partly visible, the camera is too close. If the lower body is also visible, the camera is too far.",llava_qwen,The camera is at a good position.,5,"The old response explicitly states: “The camera is at a good position,” directly addressing the old question’s definition of a good position (upper half visible, lower half not). This aligns fully with the new positive statement that the camera distance is appropriate in exactly that way.

Therefore, the alignment is very strong.

**Likert Score: 5**","The camera distance is appropriate, with the upper half of the subject’s body visible and thelower half not captured."

**QUESTION:**
Question: Indicate which of the following are true for the subject: (i) The individual's face appears blank and emotionless, even when they are trying to express an emotion. (ii) The expression is weak or asymmetrical, and the individual has difficulty holding an expression (e.g., smile) for an extended period. Also mention if you observe other facial expression abnormalities."".",llava_qwen,"(i) The individual's face appears blank and emotionless, even when they are trying to express an emotion.",1,"The old response explicitly states that the individual's face appears ""blank and emotionless, even when they are trying to express an emotion."" This directly contradicts the new statement, which describes natural, emotionally appropriate expressions without a blank/emotionless appearance. Therefore, the alignment with the new question is very poor.

**Likert Score: 1**","The subject’s facial expressions are natural, emotionally appropriate, and symmetrical (noblank/emotionless face, weakness, asymmetry, or difficulty holding expressions)."

**QUESTION:**
Question: Provide a brief description of the subject's perceived state of mind, noting whether they appear energetic, exhausted, calm, confused, or exhibit any other relevant emotional or cognitive cues.",llava_qwen,"The subject appears calm and focused, with no significant changes in their emotional or cognitive state throughout the video.",5,"The old response states the subject is ""calm and focused, with no significant changes in their emotional or cognitive state.""  
This directly supports ""calm"" and implies ""alert"" through the word ""focused.""  
While it does not explicitly mention exhaustion, confusion, or inappropriate energy levels, the absence of significant changes and the stable, focused state strongly suggest no such issues were observed.

Overall, the response aligns very well with the new statement.

**Likert Score: 5**","The subject appears calm and alert, with no signs of exhaustion, confusion, or inappropriate energy levels."

**QUESTION:**
Question: How far is the camera? A good position of the camera would be when the upper half of the subject's body remains visible, while the lower half is not captured in the frame. If the upper body is only partly visible, the camera is too close. If the lower body is also visible, the camera is too far.",llava_qwen,The camera is at a good position.,5,"The old response directly states: “The camera is at a good position.”  

Given the old question’s definition of a “good position” (upper half visible, lower half not visible), this response implies agreement that the camera distance matches that description. There is no indication of disagreement or uncertainty.

Therefore, it strongly aligns with the new positive statement.

**Likert Score: 5**","The camera distance is appropriate, with the upper half of the subject’s body visible and thelower half not captured."

**QUESTION:**
Question: How far is the camera? A good position of the camera would be when the upper half of the subject's body remains visible, while the lower half is not captured in the frame. If the upper body is only partly visible, the camera is too close. If the lower body is also visible, the camera is too far.",llava_qwen,The camera is at a good position.,5,"The old response explicitly states: “The camera is at a good position.”  
Given the old question’s definition of a “good position” (upper half visible, lower half not visible), this directly affirms that the camera distance matches the desired framing described in the new question. There is no indication of disagreement or uncertainty.

Therefore, the response strongly aligns with the new positive statement.

**Likert Score: 5**","The camera distance is appropriate, with the upper half of the subject’s body visible and thelower half not captured."
