Since the video is unsupervised, there may be noise, imperfect task execution, or deviations from standard instructions. Your role is to carefully observe and describe the following aspects without making diagnostic judgments or conclusions regarding the diseases.

Task instructions: The person will talk about a recent book they have read or a movie or TV show they have watched. For this task, the face is crucial body part you should focus on. Additionally, you should also observe other body parts for relevant symptoms or signs of Parkinson's disease. However, do not give your judgement as clinician other than answering the question very carefully analyzing the video.

Since the video is unsupervised, there may be noise, imperfect task execution, or deviations from standard instructions. Your role is to carefully observe and describe the following aspects without making diagnostic judgments or conclusions regarding the diseases.

Task instructions: The person will talk about a recent book they have read or a movie or TV show they have watched. For this task, the face is crucial body part you should focus on. Additionally, you should also observe other body parts for relevant symptoms or signs of Parkinson's disease. However, do not give your judgement as clinician other than answering the question very carefully analyzing the video.

Please only answer the question from the video. Keep your response precise and to the point.
