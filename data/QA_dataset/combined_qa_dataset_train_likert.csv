For example, was the subject wearing a mask that may have obstructed important visual information? Or did the face go out of frame while the subject was completing the task?",relatively good considering lighting ,13,Nami,4,"The response “relatively good considering lighting” suggests that visibility of critical body parts was mostly acceptable, with lighting being the only noted issue. There is no mention of any body parts being obstructed or out of frame, implying they were generally visible. However, “relatively good” is not a strong, unambiguous affirmation of full, continuous visibility.

A moderately positive alignment with the statement is most appropriate.

Or did the face go out of frame while the subject was completing the task?",adequate,13,Cayla,4,"The response ""adequate"" to the old question suggests that visibility of critical body parts was sufficient for the task and that there were no notable issues with obstruction or going out of frame. This implies general agreement with the statement that all critical body parts remained fully visible, though the wording is not emphatic enough to be certain of perfect visibility.

Thus, a slightly conservative but positive rating is appropriate.

The response is simply “visible,” which implies that the relevant body parts were indeed visible rather than obstructed or out of frame. This aligns well with the new positive statement that all critical body parts remain fully visible throughout the task.

Given the brevity but clear implication that visibility was not an issue, the response strongly supports the new statement.

The partial invisibility is brief and limited to the top of the head, which is usually not critical. Thus, the statement that all critical body parts remain fully visible is mostly but not perfectly true.
