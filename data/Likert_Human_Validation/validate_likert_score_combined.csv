24,Motor Performance and Task Execution,C-Natalia,"Please indicate whether the subject was able to follow the instructions while completing the task. If the subject was doing something differently, please describe.","subject follows instructions and completes task, but talks about a TV series instead of book or movie",The subject followed all instructions accurately while completing the task (no deviationsobserved).,2,"The response states that the subject ""follows instructions and completes task,"" but also notes a clear deviation: they talk about a TV series instead of a book or movie, which was presumably required. This means the subject did not follow all instructions accurately and there was a noticeable deviation.

Thus, alignment with “no deviations observed” is low but not zero, since they did complete the task generally as instructed.

Conclude with a final answer: ""Yes"" or ""No"".",No.,The subject does not use complex or difficult-to-understand sentences.,5,"The old question asks whether the subject is using complex, difficult-to-understand sentences, and the response is ""No."" This means the respondent is saying the subject is *not* using complex or difficult sentences. The new question is a positive statement of that same idea: ""The subject does not use complex or difficult-to-understand sentences."" The response directly agrees with this statement.

92,Facial Expression and Ocular Analysis,LlaVA-Qwen,"Indicate which of the following are true for the subject: (i) The individual's face appears blank and emotionless, even when they are trying to express an emotion. (ii) The expression is weak or asymmetrical, and the individual has difficulty holding an expression (e.g., smile) for an extended period. Also mention if you observe other facial expression abnormalities. If there is nothing abnormal, output ""nothing abnormal"".","(i) The individual's face appears blank and emotionless, even when they are trying to express an emotion.","The subject’s facial expressions are natural, emotionally appropriate, and symmetrical (noblank/emotionless face, weakness, asymmetry, or difficulty holding expressions).",1,"The response explicitly states that the individual's face appears ""blank and emotionless,"" which directly contradicts the NEW_QUESTION’s description of natural, emotionally appropriate expressions. It indicates an abnormality rather than normal facial expressiveness and thus is in strong disagreement with the positive statement.

75,Motor Performance and Task Execution,LlaVA-Qwen,"Please describe whether the person demonstrates any difficulty through their facial expressions. Some examples of visible difficulty include furrowed brow, squinting eyes, clenched jaw, tight lips, head hanging low, sighing, wrinkled forehead, etc. Mention such specific details when found. End output with a final answer choice: ""Yes"" or ""No"".","The person demonstrates difficulty through their facial expressions, such as furrowed brow and tight lips.",The person shows no signs of difficulty in facial expressions.,1,"The response explicitly states that “The person demonstrates difficulty through their facial expressions, such as furrowed brow and tight lips.” This directly contradicts the new statement that the person shows no signs of difficulty in facial expressions. Therefore, alignment with the NEW_QUESTION is very low.

The NEW_QUESTION is a positive statement: ""The subject does not use complex or difficult-to-understand sentences."" This directly matches the meaning of the response ""No"" to the OLD_QUESTION.

Thus, the alignment is very strong.

Some examples of visible difficulty include furrowed brow, squinting eyes, clenched jaw, tight lips, head hanging low, sighing, wrinkled forehead, etc. Mention such specific details when found. End output with a final answer choice: ""Yes"" or ""No"".","wrinkled forehead, frequent pauses that increased midway into the recording",The person shows no signs of difficulty in facial expressions.,1,"The old response explicitly notes “wrinkled forehead,” which is one of the listed signs of visible difficulty, and mentions “frequent pauses,” suggesting increased difficulty over time. This directly contradicts the new statement that the person shows no signs of difficulty in facial expressions. Therefore, alignment with the new question is very low.

61,Technical Quality and Environmental Context,LlaVA-Qwen,"Indicate if any body part critical for this task is partially visible (or invisible). For example, was the subject wearing a mask that may have obstructed important visual information? Or did the face go out of frame while the subject was completing the task?","No, the face was visible throughout the video.","All critical body parts (e.g., unobstructed face) remain fully visible in the frame throughout the task.",5,"The response explicitly states that “the face was visible throughout the video” and that there was no obstruction (“No” to any critical part being partially visible or invisible). This directly supports the idea that a key critical body part (the face) remained fully visible for the entire task, aligning strongly with the new positive statement.

72,Motor Performance and Task Execution,LlaVA-Qwen,"Document any abnormal signs observed in body parts other than the face. This includes, but is not limited to, tremors in the hands, involuntary shaking or rhythmic movements of the upper or lower extremities, stiffness or rigidity in the limbs, reduced arm swing while speaking, or any signs of bradykinesia (slowness of movement). Additionally, note any abnormal postures, difficulty in maintaining balance, or other motor irregularities that may be indicative of Parkinson's disease.",No abnormal signs were observed in the person's body parts other than the face.,"No abnormal signs are observed in body parts (e.g., no tremors, involuntary shaking, stiffness,rigidity, reduced arm swing, slowness, abnormal posture, or balance issues).",5,"The response explicitly states: “No abnormal signs were observed in the person's body parts other than the face.”  

The new question is a positive statement that no abnormal signs (tremors, stiffness, abnormal posture, etc.) are observed in body parts. This matches exactly what the response reports—an absence of abnormalities in non-facial body parts.  

Therefore, the alignment is complete and unambiguous.

15,Technical Quality and Environmental Context,C-Cayla,"How far is the camera? A good position of the camera would be when the upper half of the subject's body remains visible, while the lower half is not captured in the frame. If the upper body is only partly visible, the camera is too close. If the lower body is also visible, the camera is too far.",too close,"The camera distance is appropriate, with the upper half of the subject’s body visible and thelower half not captured.",1,"The old response says “too close,” which directly indicates that the camera distance is *not* appropriate according to the described standard. The new question asserts that the camera distance *is* appropriate, so the response contradicts this statement.

93,Facial Expression and Ocular Analysis,LlaVA-Qwen,"Indicate the extent of lips parting when the subject is not saying anything (i.e., always/most of the times/sometimes/very few times/never).",most of the times,"The subject’s lips are never parted when not speaking (e.g., closed or slightly parted most ofthe time).",1,"The old response says the subject’s lips are parted “most of the times” when not speaking.  
The new statement claims the lips are *never* parted (i.e., generally closed). These are in direct contradiction: “most of the times” parted vs. “never” parted.  
Thus, the response strongly disagrees with the new statement.

This directly supports the ""appears calm"" part of the new statement but provides no information about alertness, exhaustion, confusion, or energy levels. Since it partially aligns but does not confirm the full statement, a moderate agreement score is appropriate.
